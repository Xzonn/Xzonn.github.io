MovieSerifText_4a_0013_M	Wasabi is too strong a taste\nfor children.
MovieSerifText_4a_0014_M	They're learning young the\ncorrect way to experience sushi.
MovieSerifText_4a_0015_M	I'm doing them a favor!
MovieSerifText_4a_0016_M	Hrrrrhhh...
MovieSerifText_4a_0017_M	Don't force your tastes on\nothers!
MovieSerifText_4a_0018_M	Girls!

MovieSerifText_5a_0011_F	Jinrai! What did he do?!
MovieSerifText_5a_0012_M	It's a skill that only those who\nlove sushi deeply can use.
MovieSerifText_5a_0013_M	A sushi striker's ultimate\nweapon!
MovieSerifText_5a_0014_M	He eats sushi with such\npoetry...
MovieSerifText_5a_0015_M	that it enthralls his enemy,\nlocking them in place!

MovieSerifText_5a_0040_M	Dad!
MovieSerifText_5a_0040_F	Dad!
MovieSerifText_5a_0041_M	I thought you were dead!
MovieSerifText_5a_0041_F	I thought you were dead!
MovieSerifText_5a_0042_M	Yes... Jubay is dead to\nthe world.
MovieSerifText_5a_0043_M	I live now only as Tiburon\nof the Imperial Army!
MovieSerifText_5a_0044_M	How could you...
MovieSerifText_5a_0044_F	How could you...
MovieSerifText_5a_0045_M	How could you?!
MovieSerifText_5a_0045_F	How could you?!
MovieSerifText_5a_0046_M	You fought on the side of the\nRepublic!
MovieSerifText_5a_0046_F	You fought on the side of the\nRepublic!
MovieSerifText_5a_0047_M	I was once a sushi striker who\nagreed with the Republic's ideals.
MovieSerifText_5a_0048_M	I fought the Empire in the\nSushi Struggles.
MovieSerifText_5a_0049_M	Our dream was to provide sushi\nfor everyone, everywhere.
MovieSerifText_5a_0050_M	However...
MovieSerifText_5a_0090_M	I broke ties with the Republic\nwhen I saw their true colors.
MovieSerifText_5a_0051_M	It was then that I defected to\nthe Empire.
MovieSerifText_5a_0052_M	"True colors"? What do\nyou mean?
MovieSerifText_5a_0052_F	"True colors"? What do\nyou mean?
MovieSerifText_5a_0053_M	Listen to me, Musashi.
MovieSerifText_5a_0054_M	The Republic was taking the gift\nof sushi too much for granted.
MovieSerifText_5a_0055_M	Somewhere along the way,\nthey lost sight of what made\nsushi sacred.
MovieSerifText_5a_0056_M	Things got so bad that they\neven failed to clean their plates.
MovieSerifText_5a_0057_M	Mind you...that's the least of\nthe SLF's crimes...
MovieSerifText_5a_0058_M	Enough, Jubay.
MovieSerifText_5a_0059_M	Or...should I be calling you\nGeneral Tiburon?
MovieSerifText_5a_0060_M	There you are.
MovieSerifText_5a_0061_M	Our "true colors"?
MovieSerifText_5a_0091_M	Stop trying to poison the boy\nagainst us.
MovieSerifText_5a_0091_F	Stop trying to poison the girl\nagainst us.
MovieSerifText_5a_0062_M	Only the Sushi Liberation\nFront...
MovieSerifText_5a_0092_M	is a force for good!
MovieSerifText_5a_0063_M	So it was you who told Musashi\nI died.
MovieSerifText_5a_0064_M	Yes.
MovieSerifText_5a_0065_M	The day you betrayed the\ncause, you were dead to me.
MovieSerifText_5a_0066_M	I'm not the traitor here!
MovieSerifText_5a_0067_M	Your SLF's methods betray the\nsushi sprites!
MovieSerifText_5a_0068_M	That's not...
MovieSerifText_5a_0069_M	What does he mean, Masa?
MovieSerifText_5a_0069_F	What does he mean, Masa?
MovieSerifText_5a_0070_M	Listen, Musashi.
MovieSerifText_5a_0071_M	Because of this man\nyour mother...
MovieSerifText_5a_0073_M	You lie! That decision was hers\nto make!
MovieSerifText_5a_0074_M	What is this? What happened\nto Mom?!
MovieSerifText_5a_0074_F	What is this? What happened\nto Mom?!
MovieSerifText_5a_0075_M	For that...
MovieSerifText_5a_0093_M	you should ask Masa.
MovieSerifText_5a_0076_M	Good-bye...
MovieSerifText_5a_0077_M	My son.
MovieSerifText_5a_0077_F	My daughter.
MovieSerifText_5a_0078_M	Aah... W-wait! Don't leave!
MovieSerifText_5a_0078_F	Aah... W-wait! Don't leave!
MovieSerifText_5a_0081_M	Oh, I can move.
MovieSerifText_5a_0081_F	Oh, I can move.
MovieSerifText_5a_0082_M	Musashi, wait.
MovieSerifText_5a_0083_M	I have bad news.
MovieSerifText_5a_0084_M	I'm afraid the SLF spread itself\ntoo thin. We've taken too\nmany losses.
MovieSerifText_5a_0085_M	Seriously?!
MovieSerifText_5a_0085_F	Seriously?!
MovieSerifText_5a_0086_M	We must withdraw and bolster\nour forces.
MovieSerifText_5a_0087_M	Aw man...the bridge...

MovieSerifText_5b_0002_F	Is what my dadâ€”I mean\nTiburonâ€”said for real?!

MovieSerifText_5b_0005_M	Musashi... You are the SLF's\nbest hope right now.
MovieSerifText_5b_0006_M	Don't fall for the Empire's\nobvious lies.
MovieSerifText_5b_0007_M	But you said my dad was dead!

MovieSerifText_5b_0008_F	How am I supposed to believe\nyou about anything when you\nlied about that?!
MovieSerifText_5b_0009_M	Just tell me the truth!
MovieSerifText_5b_0009_F	Just tell me the truth!
MovieSerifText_5b_0010_M	Musashi.
MovieSerifText_5b_0011_M	First answer one thing for me. 
MovieSerifText_5b_0012_M	What is it that you are\nfighting for?
MovieSerifText_5b_0075_M	Your own personal right to\neat sushi?
MovieSerifText_5b_0013_M	Or...
MovieSerifText_5b_0014_M	something more?
MovieSerifText_5b_0015_M	Of course there's more to it!
MovieSerifText_5b_0015_F	Of course there's more to it!
MovieSerifText_5b_0016_M	I fight to bring sushi to all the\nchildren of the world!
MovieSerifText_5b_0016_F	I fight to bring sushi to all the\nchildren of the world!
MovieSerifText_5b_0017_M	I see. 
MovieSerifText_5b_0018_M	One more question, then.
MovieSerifText_5b_0019_M	To achieve that noble goal...
MovieSerifText_5b_0020_M	are you prepared to go to\nany lengths necessary?
MovieSerifText_5b_0021_M	Uh, like what?
MovieSerifText_5b_0021_F	Uh, like what?
MovieSerifText_5b_0022_M	Come this way.
MovieSerifText_5b_0023_M	I'll show you the secret of\nthe Sushi Liberation Front's\nstrength.
MovieSerifText_5b_0024_M	There's...a secret?
MovieSerifText_5b_0025_M	Guhh!
MovieSerifText_5b_0025_F	Guhh!
MovieSerifText_5b_0026_M	What...IS this?
MovieSerifText_5b_0026_F	What...IS this?
MovieSerifText_5b_0027_M	The sign of a sushi striker's\nstrength.
MovieSerifText_5b_0028_M	We must eat sushi quickly,\npiling up the plates as fast as\npossible.
MovieSerifText_5b_0029_M	To do that, we omit every\nunnecessary bite.
MovieSerifText_5b_0030_M	     
MovieSerifText_5b_0031_M	Aaahhh!
MovieSerifText_5b_0031_F	Aaahhh!
MovieSerifText_5b_0032_M	No way!
MovieSerifText_5b_0032_F	No way!
MovieSerifText_5b_0033_M	Is this a sick joke?!
MovieSerifText_5b_0033_F	Is this a sick joke?!
MovieSerifText_5b_0034_M	Not at all.
MovieSerifText_5b_0076_M	We need only the tastiest parts.
MovieSerifText_5b_0035_M	The rice is unnecessary.
MovieSerifText_5b_0036_M	This is such a waste!
MovieSerifText_5b_0036_F	This is such a waste!
MovieSerifText_5b_0037_M	A waste, hmm?
MovieSerifText_5b_0038_M	That isn't how I see it.
MovieSerifText_5b_0039_M	You know...
MovieSerifText_5b_0040_M	In my opinion, the most\ngratifying method of\neating sushi...
MovieSerifText_5b_0041_M	is to eat only what you like.
MovieSerifText_5b_0042_M	That's just wrong!
MovieSerifText_5b_0042_F	That's just wrong!
MovieSerifText_5b_0078_M	You should be ashamed!
MovieSerifText_5b_0078_F	You should be ashamed!
MovieSerifText_5b_0043_M	This is sushi heresy!
MovieSerifText_5b_0044_M	Heresy?
MovieSerifText_5b_0077_M	That strikes me as a bit much.
MovieSerifText_5b_0045_M	How can it be called heresy...
MovieSerifText_5b_0079_M	when it has won so\nmany battles? 
MovieSerifText_5b_0046_M	That's no excuse!
MovieSerifText_5b_0046_F	That's no excuse!
MovieSerifText_5b_0047_M	Musashi!
MovieSerifText_5b_0048_M	Your father...
MovieSerifText_5b_0049_M	the legendary sushi striker\nJubay said the same thing once.
MovieSerifText_5b_0050_M	He challenged me to a duel.
MovieSerifText_5b_0051_M	How do you think that went\nfor him?
MovieSerifText_5b_0052_M	He was soundly defeated and\nfled the Republic in shame.
MovieSerifText_5b_0053_M	Your mother went with him,\nleaving you behind as\nan orphan.
MovieSerifText_5b_0054_M	My mom...
MovieSerifText_5b_0054_F	My mom...
MovieSerifText_5b_0055_M	She must have had a reason!
MovieSerifText_5b_0055_F	She must have had a reason!
MovieSerifText_5b_0056_M	What could justify that?\nMusashi...
MovieSerifText_5b_0057_M	No one has cared for you more\nthan us.
MovieSerifText_5b_0058_M	Enough, Musashi. Don't listen\nto him!
MovieSerifText_5b_0059_M	Nghhh!
MovieSerifText_5b_0059_F	Nghhh!
MovieSerifText_5b_0060_M	Admit it, Musashi.
MovieSerifText_5b_0061_M	My victories are proof enough\nthat I am right!
MovieSerifText_5b_0062_M	The Liberation Front is your\nonly option.
MovieSerifText_5b_0063_M	Yeah, right! I'll win this my way!
MovieSerifText_5b_0063_F	Yeah, right! I'll win this my way!

MovieSerifText_5b_0064_F	Never leave a single grain\nof rice!
MovieSerifText_5b_0065_M	You eat all the sushi or none\nof it!
MovieSerifText_5b_0065_F	You eat all the sushi or none\nof it!
MovieSerifText_5b_0066_M	Musashi... We are at war.
MovieSerifText_5b_0067_M	We cannot keep our plates\nclean and win.
MovieSerifText_5b_0068_M	If you don't understand that,\nthen stay off the front lines.
MovieSerifText_5b_0069_M	Shut up!
MovieSerifText_5b_0069_F	Shut up!
MovieSerifText_5b_0070_M	Cast aside your ideals, and what\nare you fighting for?
MovieSerifText_5b_0071_M	You believe you can win?

MovieSerifText_ep_0001_M	Musashi. Now that you are\na true sushi striker, it's time\nI told you the story of sushi.
MovieSerifText_ep_0002_M	Sushi was once made of an\nanimal called fish, which swam\nin the seas.
MovieSerifText_ep_0003_M	Humanity polluted those seas,\nhowever, and the fish died out.
MovieSerifText_ep_0004_M	But the fish were reborn as\nsushi sprites, beings of\nwondrous power.
MovieSerifText_ep_0005_M	They granted the gift of sushi\nonly to those who showed the\nproper appreciation.
MovieSerifText_ep_0006_M	We sushi sprites are sustained\nby your gratitude in eating. You\nmust remember that always.
MovieSerifText_ep_0007_M	Thanks for telling me.\nNo matter how much sushi\nI eat, I won't forget where it\ncame from.
MovieSerifText_ep_0007_F	Thanks for telling me.\nNo matter how much sushi\nI eat, I won't forget where it\ncame from.
MovieSerifText_ep_0008_M	Mom...didn't come home\ntoday either.
MovieSerifText_ep_0008_F	Mom...didn't come home\ntoday either.
MovieSerifText_ep_0009_M	But I'm sure that some day\nwe'll meet again.
MovieSerifText_ep_0009_F	But I'm sure that some day\nwe'll meet again.
MovieSerifText_ep_0010_M	Because as long as we\nremember to give thanks,\nsushi is forever!
MovieSerifText_ep_0010_F	Because as long as we\nremember to give thanks,\nsushi is forever!
MovieSerifText_ep_0011_M	Though Musashi dreamed of\na family reunion, until that day\ncame, a life of eating sushi with\nfriends was enough.

TipsName_001	Linking Plates
TipsPage1_001	You can eat sushi by using the stylus to\nlink {c[dc0000]}2 or more plates of the same color\n{c[000000]}together and then lifting the stylus.\nYou have up to {c[dc0000]}7 seconds{c[000000]} to link plates.\nIf you take longer than 7 seconds, the\nwhole stack of plates will disappear!
TipsPage2_001	If a plate that's part of your link {c[dc0000]}flows off\nthe screen, you can no longer add to\nthe link{c[000000]}, but you'll still eat any sushi\non the plates you've already linked.
TipsName_002	The Shared Lane
TipsPage1_002	In addition to the 3 lanes you and your\nopponent each control, there is a {c[006e00]}shared\nlane{c[000000]}. Sushi flowing down this lane is {c[dc0000]}up\nfor grabs by either side{c[000000]}! First come,\nfirst served!
TipsPage2_002	The sushi that appears on the {c[006e00]}shared\nlane{c[000000]} is selected {c[dc0000]}randomly {c[000000]}from the sushi\nsummoned by the {c[dc0000]}first sushi sprite{c[000000]} in\nyou and your opponent's rosters.
TipsName_003	Lane Drive
TipsPage1_003	You can activate the {c[006e00]}lane drive{c[000000]} while\nlinking plates by {c[dc0000]}holding the stylus\ndown on the touch screen{c[000000]}.
TipsPage2_003	The lane drive won't work if you lift\nthe stylus or move it too much.\n{c[dc0000]}Keep it as still as possible{c[000000]}â€”waiting for\nsushi to flow toward you is the key!
TipsName_004	Fruit & Sweets
TipsPage1_004	In addition to sushi, plates of {c[006e00]}fruit{c[000000]}\nsometimes flow from the shrines.\n{c[006e00]}Sweets {c[000000]}will also appear on the lanes\nwhen you activate {c[006e00]}Sweets Paradise{c[000000]}!
TipsPage2_004	Eating the {c[006e00]}fruit {c[000000]}from plates you link will\n{c[dc0000]}restore a little HP{c[000000]}. However, sweets\ndon't appear on plates, so you must {c[dc0000]}tap{c[000000]}\nthem one by one. When you do, they\n{c[dc0000]}restore more HP{c[000000]} than fruit does!
TipsName_005	Plate Colors
TipsPage1_005	There are {c[dc0000]}9 colors of sushi plates{c[000000]}.\nEach color does a different amount of\ndamage, as shown in The 8 Precepts.\nThe higher the quality of sushi, the\nbetter the damage. However, overall\ndamage is {c[dc0000]}more complicated{c[000000]} than that!
TipsPage2_005	A stack of plates gets {c[dc0000]}more powerful\n{c[000000]}the {c[dc0000]}more plates{c[000000]} that are in it! The bonus\nincreases as the stack grows, reaching\nits maximum at {c[dc0000]}20 plates or more{c[000000]}!
TipsName_006	Toppling Stacks
TipsPage1_006	Not only does throwing plates deal\ndamage to your enemy, depending on\nthe {c[dc0000]}attack strength of the plates you\nthrow{c[000000]}, it could even {c[dc0000]}topple the stack\nof plates{c[000000]} the enemy is building up!
TipsName_007	Same Sushi Bonus
TipsPage1_007	Connecting plates of the {c[dc0000]}same color{c[000000]} is\ngood, but if the sushi on them is all the\nsame type, that's even better!\nAn attack with a {c[dc0000]}same-sushi stack\n{c[000000]}is {c[dc0000]}30% stronger {c[000000]}than normal.
TipsName_008	Sushi Jubilee
TipsPage1_008	Eating sushi fills your {c[006e00]}jubilee gauge{c[000000]}.\nWhen the gauge is full, it's time for a\n{c[006e00]}sushi jubilee{c[000000]}! {c[dc0000]}For about 12 seconds,\nyour attacks do 150% normal damage{c[000000]},\nplus you'll see higher-quality sushi!
TipsPage2_008	What's more, during a {c[006e00]}sushi jubilee{c[000000]},\nthe same types of sushi will appear in\n{c[dc0000]}sequences of 2 or more{c[000000]}, making it\neasier to link tall stacks of plates!
TipsPage3_008	The more {c[dc0000]}tall stacks{c[000000]} you link, the more\nyour {c[006e00]}jubilee gauge{c[000000]} fills and the faster\nyou can reach the next {c[006e00]}sushi jubilee{c[000000]}!\nTry to link as many plates as you can!
TipsName_009	Glowing Plates
TipsPage1_009	{c[dc0000]}Link 7 or more{c[000000]} plates to draw out a\n{c[006e00]}glowing plate{c[000000]} from the shrine! {c[006e00]}Glowing\nplates {c[000000]}can link to any other color, and\neach one has an attack strength of 70.
TipsPage2_009	Furthermore, stacks that include {c[006e00]}glowing\nplates{c[000000]} are protected by a rainbow aura,\nmaking them {c[dc0000]}impervious to enemy shots{c[000000]}!
TipsName_010	Combo Attacks
TipsPage1_010	Hitting with {c[dc0000]}several stacks of the same\ncolor in succession{c[000000]} is a {c[006e00]}combo{c[000000]}. They do\nextra damage {c[dc0000]}based on the total damage\ndealt{c[000000]} from up to five previous throws!
TipsPage2_010	The damage bonus takes into account\n{c[dc0000]}how hard the previous throws hit{c[000000]}, so\nwhen there are lots of same-colored\nstacks on the table, it's best to throw\nthe {c[dc0000]}taller stacks first{c[000000]}!
TipsPage3_010	{c[dc0000]}Stacks that contain{c[000000]} {c[006e00]}glowing plates{c[000000]}\nare special and always form {c[006e00]}combos{c[000000]}.\nPlus, the window for making {c[006e00]}combos{c[000000]}\nwith them {c[dc0000]}never expires{c[000000]}. Use them\nto really extend a combo!
TipsName_011	Types of Throwing
TipsPage1_011	A sushi striker can have up to {c[dc0000]}5 stacks \n{c[000000]}on the table at once. If they make a sixth\nstack, then the first stack still on the\ntable is {c[dc0000]}thrown automatically{c[000000]}.
TipsPage2_011	However, you can also {c[dc0000]}manually throw\n{c[000000]}any stack you like. {c[dc0000]}Automatic{c[000000]} and {c[dc0000]}manual{c[000000]}\nthrows have the same attack strength,\nbut manual throwing helps when\nforming combos.
TipsName_012	Manual Throwing
TipsPage1_012	Many skilled sushi strikers don't know\nthat if you {c[dc0000]}manually throw{c[000000]} the stacks\non your table, you'll get a {c[dc0000]}breakdown\nof the damage {c[000000]}you delivered!
TipsPage2_012	While the breakdown isn't exact,\nit's a good way to see the effects\nof your {c[006e00]}skills{c[000000]} and {c[006e00]}combos{c[000000]}. Refine\nyour tactics based on what you learn!
TipsName_013	Sushi Sprite Skills
TipsPage1_013	Sushi sprites have their own unique\n{c[006e00]}skills{c[000000]}. Their skill gauges fill as you eat\nsushi, allowing you to activate them\nonce the gauge is {c[dc0000]}full{c[000000]}!
TipsPage2_013	For example, {c[006e00]}Jinrai{c[000000]}'s Sushi Bonanza skill\nallows you to link plates of any color.\nWhen doing so, the {c[dc0000]}highest-quality sushi{c[000000]}\nyou link will determine the color of the\nplate stack. So using this skill when\nhigh-quality sushi is available is key!
TipsPage3_013	Unlike stack damage and the\n{c[006e00]}jubilee gauge{c[000000]}, there's {c[dc0000]}no added\nbonus to filling the skill gauge from\nthe number of plates in a stack{c[000000]}.
TipsPage4_013	This means that the fastest way to refill\nthe gauge is to {c[dc0000]}grab whatever sushi you\ncan{c[000000]} without waiting to link lots of plates.
TipsName_014	Leveling Up
TipsPage1_014	Musashi and the sushi sprites each\nhave {c[dc0000]}their own{c[000000]} levels. They gain levels\nby earning EXP. Leveling up raises\nMusashi's {c[006e00]}Stamina{c[000000]} and the sushi\nsprite's {c[006e00]}Defense{c[000000]}.
TipsPage2_014	When sushi sprites level up, the sushi \non their {c[dc0000]}menu gets stronger{c[000000]} and the\nquality of their sushi gradually increases.\nBasically, their {c[dc0000]}attack strength grows{c[000000]}!
TipsPage3_014	Leveling up also increases Musashi's\n{c[006e00]}Strength{c[000000]}. This means {c[dc0000]}throwing the\nsame plates deals even more damage{c[000000]}!
TipsPage4_014	You earn EXP by battling, but you also\nget bonus EXP for {c[dc0000]}every new star\nyou earn{c[000000]}!
TipsName_015	HP & Stamina
TipsPage1_015	Musashi's max {c[006e00]}HP{c[000000]} in battle is {c[dc0000]}the sum\ntotal {c[000000]}of Musashi's {c[006e00]}Stamina{c[000000]} and the\n{c[006e00]}Defense {c[000000]}from each of the active sprites.
TipsPage2_015	So even without raising Musashi's\nStamina, {c[dc0000]}putting different sushi sprites\n{c[000000]}in the active sprite group will change\nMusashi's {c[dc0000]}max HP{c[000000]}!
TipsName_016	Sprite Skill Levels
TipsPage1_016	In addition to a sushi sprite's EXP {c[006e00]}level{c[000000]},\na sushi sprite's {c[006e00]}Skill Level{c[000000]} also increases.\nWhen its {c[006e00]}Skill Level {c[000000]}increases, its skills\nhave {c[dc0000]}strengthened effects{c[000000]}. 
TipsPage2_016	You can increase {c[006e00]}Skill Levels{c[000000]} by using\na {c[006e00]}Skill Charm{c[000000]} on the sprite or by\nreceiving {c[006e00]}Sushi Essence{c[000000]} from a sushi\nsprite who offers to pledge with you after\na battle. Use your {c[006e00]}Skill Charms{c[000000]} wisely!
TipsName_017	Score & Rating
TipsPage1_017	Your {c[006e00]}Score{c[000000]} increases as you {c[dc0000]}stack plates{c[000000]}\nand {c[dc0000]}deal damage{c[000000]}. You'll also get a bonus\nto your score after winning a battle\nbased on {c[dc0000]}how long it took to win{c[000000]}.

TipsPage1_020	Sushi sprites who participate in battle are\ncalled active sushi sprites. You can\nprepare {c[dc0000]}3 sets{c[000000]} of active sprites on the\n{c[006e00]}Sprite Order screen{c[000000]}.
TipsPage2_020	Try creating things like a balanced set, \nan attack-boosting set, and a saboteur\nset in advance, and {c[dc0000]}change between\nthem depending on your needs{c[000000]}! 
TipsPage3_020	When you play multiplayer matches,\nyou can {c[dc0000]}change{c[000000]} sets between games\nto try fresh strategies!
TipsName_021	Reserve Sprites
TipsPage1_021	{c[006e00]}Reserve sushi sprites {c[000000]}don't take part in\nbattle but can still earn EXP! You can\ndesignate up to {c[dc0000]}2{c[000000]} {c[006e00]}reserve sprites{c[000000]}.
TipsName_022	Raw Power
TipsPage1_022	When you eat {c[dc0000]}a great deal of one type\nof sushi in a certain time{c[000000]}, that sushi's\n{c[006e00]}raw power{c[000000]} dwells within you. If you\ndeclare that sushi as your {c[006e00]}Favorite{c[000000]} on\nthe {c[006e00]}Striker Specs{c[000000]} screen, you can\nharness that {c[006e00]}raw power{c[000000]} during battle!
TipsPage2_022	Once you do that, the {c[006e00]}raw power{c[000000]} will\n{c[dc0000]}kick in automatically{c[000000]} by fulfilling\ncertain conditions! Try experimenting\nwith how different kinds of raw power\nwork together with sushi sprite skills!
TipsName_023	Potential Plates
TipsPage1_023	You will probably come across a Potential\nPlate at some point on your journey.\nThis is a {c[006e00]}pledge plate{c[000000]} {c[dc0000]}that has no owner\nbut has a sushi sprite{c[000000]} hidden within!
TipsPage2_023	If you set it as your {c[006e00]}Prepared Item {c[000000]}in\nbattle, depending on the {c[dc0000]}results{c[000000]}, the\nsushi sprite inside may reveal itself\nand {c[dc0000]}offer to pledge with you{c[000000]}.
TipsPage3_023	A high {c[006e00]}score{c[000000]} and a specific {c[006e00]}striker rank{c[000000]}\nmay be necessary for the sprite inside\nthe plate to offer its services. Do all that\nyou can to show the sushi sprite your\npassion for sushi!
TipsName_025	Multiplayer Rules
TipsPage1_025	There are {c[ff4040]}two types {c[000000]}of {c[ff4040]}multiplayer battle{c[000000]}.\n{c[006e00]}Tasteful Battle{c[000000]} is a straightforward fight\nwithout capsules, whereas {c[006e00]}Chaos Battle{c[000000]}\nhas all kinds of capsules! It's a race to\nsee who can use capsules the best!
TipsPage2_025	In a {c[ff4040]}multiplayer match{c[000000]}, Musashi and the\nsushi sprites are set to {c[dc0000]}level 30{c[000000]}.\n(Sushi sprite skill levels and stats\nboosted by items are accounted for.)
TipsPage3_025	{c[ff4040]}â– Other Rules{c[000000]}\n-Sushi Sprites with a special mark next to\nthem in the {c[006e00]}Sprite Order{c[000000]} screen can't be\nused in online play.
TipsPage4_025	-You cannot use {c[006e00]}Prepared Items{c[000000]}.\n-Each sprite's sushi reflects what it \nwould have at level 30, so things like the\n{c[006e00]}Searing Torch {c[000000]}aren't accounted for.

CharaSerif_00_M	I see. So on top of the incident with Jinrai,\nyou lost an important base to the enemy.
CharaSerif_01_M	It's one blunder after another with you,\nisn't it, Kodiak?
CharaSerif_02_M	{s[150]}That was the last one, honest!{s[100]}
CharaSerif_03_M	If the SLF grows entrenched in the Shrine\nGrove, they'll attack the border gate next.
CharaSerif_04_M	And so I must ask myself, should I risk\nleaving its defense to you?
CharaSerif_05_M	Y-you can count on me! I'll keep an iron\ngrip on the border!
CharaSerif_06_M	I hope so. Because if you fail again, even\nyou won't escape...the facility.
CharaSerif_07_M	Gah! I-it's not my fault! It's that Musashi!
CharaSerif_08_M	If we get rid of the kid, the rest of the\nSLF are pushovers!
CharaSerif_09_M	Hmm. Then do you have a plan to\naccomplish this?

CharaSerif_03_M	I overheard... So Ausprey's surrendered.
CharaSerif_04_M	It would seem so.
CharaSerif_05_M	Mmm. What now?
CharaSerif_06_M	Don't worry about that. The time has come\nfor me to show the Empire's true power.
CharaSerif_07_M	All right...
CharaSerif_08_M	Mmm... I'm hungry...
CharaSerif_09_M	She did? Purrsilla? You're certain?
CharaSerif_10_M	I overheard... So Purrsilla's surrendered.

CharaSerif_00_M	What's this about a Shrine Grove?
CharaSerif_00_F	What's this about a Shrine Grove?
CharaSerif_01_M	It's a small, isolated island in the southern\nbay that's thick with overgrown forests.
CharaSerif_02_M	Within it lie the venerable ruins of ancient\nsushi monks. Hence, the Shrine Grove.
CharaSerif_03_M	You might think of it as a spiritual home\nfor us.
CharaSerif_04_M	There in that place of supreme mystical\nenergy, sushi sprites can hone their power. 
CharaSerif_05_M	It was once protected by vigilant villagers,\nbut the Empire occupied it in the Struggles.
CharaSerif_06_M	However, the Sushi Liberation Front has\nvowed to reclaim it as our headquarters!
CharaSerif_07_M	Striking a blow to the Empire and bolstering\nour forces at the same time. A sound idea.
CharaSerif_08_M	Isn't it? I thought so, anyway.
CharaSerif_09_M	Yeah, it sounds great! But where do I\ncome in?
CharaSerif_09_F	Yeah, it sounds great! But where do I\ncome in?
CharaSerif_10_M	I'm glad you asked. You have a special job:\nto engage the enemy away from our forces.
CharaSerif_11_M	The Empire is aware of Jinrai now,\nputting you squarely in their sights.
CharaSerif_12_M	While all eyes are on you, my forces\nwill have room to work.
CharaSerif_13_M	Are you implying...our job is to be bait?!
CharaSerif_14_M	I'm sorry if it's not the role you'd prefer\nto play.
CharaSerif_15_M	Relax, chief! Anything for the SLF!
CharaSerif_15_F	Relax, chief! Anything for the SLF!

CharaSerif_08_M	So... How long are we going to hang\naround here?
CharaSerif_08_F	So... How long are we going to hang\naround here?
CharaSerif_10_M	We need a headquarters, Musashi.\nThis Shrine Grove is the best candidate.
CharaSerif_12_M	But if we stay here too long building it,\nthe Empire will be on the move!
CharaSerif_12_F	But if we stay here too long building it,\nthe Empire will be on the move!
CharaSerif_13_M	C'mon, Masa! You gotta let me push them\nback to the border!
CharaSerif_13_F	C'mon, Masa! You gotta let me push them\nback to the border!
CharaSerif_14_M	It's a delicate balance to walk.
CharaSerif_15_M	(Hmm. If I pull too tight on his leash,\nhe may end up slipping it entirely.)
CharaSerif_15_F	(Hmm. If I pull too tight on her leash,\nshe may end up slipping it entirely.)
CharaSerif_19_M	Very well. You have my permission to\ndrive them back to the border.
CharaSerif_20_M	Great!
CharaSerif_20_F	Great!
CharaSerif_21_M	But their border defenses are formidable.\nDon't stray too close or be too reckless.
CharaSerif_23_M	You got it! "Safety first" and all!
CharaSerif_23_F	You got it! "Safety first" and all!
CharaSerif_24_M	I don't understand what your hurry is.
CharaSerif_25_M	Look, the guys who took Franklin can't have\ngotten far yet! I gotta do something!
CharaSerif_25_F	Look, the guys who took Franklin can't have\ngotten far yet! I gotta do something!
CharaSerif_26_M	Hmm... I take your point, but the ability to\ncompromise is a mark of maturity.
CharaSerif_27_M	Ugh... These "maturity" comments aren't\nsubtle, y'know!
CharaSerif_27_F	Ugh... These "maturity" comments aren't\nsubtle, y'know!
CharaSerif_28_M	That said, I find that I like Masa better\nfrom a safe remove.

CharaSerif_10_M	{s[150]}Fantastically done!{s[100]}
CharaSerif_11_M	Thanks to your contributions, we pushed all\nthe way to the trading city of Benteaux.
CharaSerif_12_M	Glad I could help!
CharaSerif_12_F	Glad I could help!
CharaSerif_13_M	From here, it's a short distance over the\nGreat Bridge to the Imperial capital.
CharaSerif_14_M	Then what are we waiting for? Let's go!
CharaSerif_14_F	Then what are we waiting for? Let's go!
CharaSerif_15_M	Not yet. The time to move on the Empire\nis not quite right.
CharaSerif_16_M	{s[150]}Why not?!{s[100]}
CharaSerif_16_F	{s[150]}Why not?!{s[100]}
CharaSerif_17_M	Between us and the Great Bridge is the\nImperial stronghold of Fort Fugu.
CharaSerif_18_M	Fort...Fugu?
CharaSerif_18_F	Fort...Fugu?
CharaSerif_19_M	It's the great bastion of the Empire. We're in\nfor a harder fight than we've ever known.
CharaSerif_20_M	Making matters worse, our scouts say that\nthe Dread General Tiburon is there.
CharaSerif_21_M	Tiburon?! Did I hear you correctly?
CharaSerif_22_M	You guys need to fill me in! Who is\nthis Tiburon guy?
CharaSerif_22_F	You guys need to fill me in! Who is\nthis Tiburon guy?
CharaSerif_23_M	Hrrrh... He may be the most powerful known\nsushi striker. He leads the Imperial Army.
CharaSerif_24_M	That sounds...bad for us.
CharaSerif_24_F	That sounds...bad for us.
CharaSerif_25_M	It is. The fortress would be hard enough\nto crack, but with him in command...
CharaSerif_27_M	Suffice to say, I'd like to take some time to\nstrengthen our forces.
CharaSerif_28_M	Strengthen them how?
CharaSerif_29_M	There are other squads pushing to open\nsushi gates elsewhere that I can move here.
CharaSerif_30_M	That could work, yes.
CharaSerif_31_M	But will the Empire give you the chance?
CharaSerif_31_F	But will the Empire give you the chance?
CharaSerif_32_M	If you wait too long here, they'll surround\nthis whole place and wipe you out!
CharaSerif_32_F	If you wait too long here, they'll surround\nthis whole place and wipe you out!
CharaSerif_33_M	I hadn't considered that.
CharaSerif_34_M	You raise a good point. Let us approach\nthe problem on two fronts.
CharaSerif_35_M	I'll remain here, calling in various forces\nto ready our assault.
CharaSerif_36_M	In the meantime, Musashi, you will strike\nat Fort Fugu to draw their attention.
CharaSerif_37_M	Decoy duty again...
CharaSerif_39_M	We're not asking you to take the city.\nLight skirmishes only. You'll do fine.
CharaSerif_40_M	I'll do better than fine! By the time your\ntroops arrive, there'll be nothing left to do!
CharaSerif_40_F	I'll do better than fine! By the time your\ntroops arrive, there'll be nothing left to do!

CharaSerif_04_M	Hrrrh. It does seem to be a closely guarded\nsecret. Even I don't know where to begin.

CharaSerif_00_M	Dad? Can you tell me about Mom?
CharaSerif_00_F	Dad? Can you tell me about Mom?
CharaSerif_01_M	What happened to her? Where is she?\nIs she...
CharaSerif_01_F	What happened to her? Where is she?\nIs she...
CharaSerif_03_M	Your mother was a priestess at the Shrine\nGrove and a scholar of sushi sprites.
CharaSerif_04_M	We were drawn to each other by our love\nof sushi. Marriage seemed a natural step.
CharaSerif_05_M	Then I went to war for the SLF and their\ndream of sushi for all the world's people...
CharaSerif_06_M	I threw myself into the Sushi Struggles.
CharaSerif_07_M	But as you know now, the SLF was rotten\nat its core.
CharaSerif_08_M	Masa and his inner circle had no love for\nsushi itself, only the pursuit of power.
CharaSerif_09_M	I opposed them, but I hadn't the strength\nat the time to challenge them directly.
CharaSerif_10_M	I was driven from the SLF. Even my close\nallies didn't know if I had survived.
CharaSerif_11_M	Yeesh.
CharaSerif_11_F	Yeesh.
CharaSerif_12_M	I somehow found my way home, but it was\ntoo late. Your mother...she...
CharaSerif_13_M	No... Don't say it...
CharaSerif_14_M	In her despair, she threw herself into the\nGreat Sushi Gate at the Shrine Grove.
CharaSerif_15_M	{s[150]}Wait, what?!{s[100]}
CharaSerif_16_M	Ah, yes... The Great Sushi Gate which\ntowers over all other sushi gates...
CharaSerif_17_M	Jinrai, do you know what happens to people\nwho go inside sushi gates?
CharaSerif_17_F	Jinrai, do you know what happens to people\nwho go inside sushi gates?
CharaSerif_18_M	Hrrrh... I'm not sure. Whatever happened\nwould be as the Supreme Sprite willed it.
CharaSerif_19_M	Personally...I believe she'll return to\nus someday.
CharaSerif_20_M	If we can make a place in this world for\nsushi over strife, maybe then...
CharaSerif_21_M	But I think now that I was foolish to believe\nthe Empire's plan could achieve that.
CharaSerif_22_M	Oh... So really, you joined the Empire for\nMom's sake?
CharaSerif_22_F	Oh... So really, you joined the Empire for\nMom's sake?
CharaSerif_23_M	Yes. But I think your way is better than mine.\nYou may succeed where I failed.
CharaSerif_24_M	You have already defeated Masa and\ncountered my Sushido. So who knows?
CharaSerif_25_M	In the coming battle...as you achieve your\ndreams, remember your father's as well.

CharaSerif_24_M	From here, we enter Imperial territory.\nResistance will be stiff going forward.
CharaSerif_25_M	Our aim is to establish a beachhead at\nthe trade city of Benteaux.
CharaSerif_26_M	But to get there, we must cross land held\nby one of the three Imperial generals.
CharaSerif_27_M	Hmm. Either the tropical seashore or the\nvolcanic mountain will get us there.
CharaSerif_28_M	Ausprey's forces at the seashore employ\nsushi sprites with tricks and high defense.
CharaSerif_29_M	As for Purrsilla's squads on the volcano,\nwe can expect brutal attack skills there.
CharaSerif_30_M	Either way, it could be a good opportunity\nto pledge those sushi sprites to our cause.
CharaSerif_31_M	The choice is yours, Musashi.
CharaSerif_32_M	The high-defense seashore!
CharaSerif_33_M	The attack-heavy volcano!
CharaSerif_34_M	Then that's what we'll prepare for.
CharaSerif_35_M	Listen, Musashi. Even in the Empire,\nsushi is rare among the common folk.

EventBattleM001_01_M	{s[150]}Huh?! Where are we?!{s[100]}
EventBattleM001_01_F	{s[150]}Huh?! Where are we?!{s[100]}
EventBattleM001_02_M	Never fear. You are in a sushi field, a place\nwhere sushi flows from sushi sprites.
EventBattleM001_03_M	But don't worry about that. I have much to\nteach you here!
EventBattleM001_04_M	You see, there's a lot you can do with\nsushi here.
EventBattleM001_05_M	Let's see you link {c[ffcc2f]}two plates of the\nsame color{c[000000]}! Go on!
EventBattleM001_06_M	You mean like that?
EventBattleM001_06_F	You mean like that?
EventBattleM001_07_M	Exactly. Now link as many plates of one\ncolor as you can!
EventBattleM001_08_M	I'm seeing a lot of plates...but no sushi.
EventBattleM001_08_F	I'm seeing a lot of plates...but no sushi.
EventBattleM001_09_M	Ah, pardon me! For that, I'll need to have\nAra-o return to the shrine for a bit.
EventBattleM001_10_M	Ara-o, if you please?
EventBattleM001_12_M	{s[150]}Whoa! Look at all the sushi!{s[100]}
EventBattleM001_12_F	{s[150]}Whoa! Look at all the sushi!{s[100]}
EventBattleM001_13_M	Eat up! Link two or more plates of the\nsame color, just as before!
EventBattleM001_14_M	Yum! I can't get enough!
EventBattleM001_14_F	Yum! I can't get enough!
EventBattleM001_16_M	I'm not surprised. Don't stop now!\nGrab as many as you can in one go!
EventBattleM001_17_M	But you only have 7 seconds to link plates.\nAfter that, they'll slip through your fingers.
EventBattleM001_18_M	The goal is to link and eat as many plates\nas you can within that 7 seconds. Try it!
EventBattleM001_19_M	{s[150]}It's better than I dreamed!{s[100]}
EventBattleM001_19_F	{s[150]}It's better than I dreamed!{s[100]}

EventBattleM002_01_M	Hm? This is where we were before...
EventBattleM002_01_F	Hm? This is where we were before...
EventBattleM002_02_M	Hey, what's this "attacking with plates"\nstuff about? How do I do that?
EventBattleM002_02_F	Hey, what's this "attacking with plates"\nstuff about? How do I do that?
EventBattleM002_03_M	Just like before, link at least two plates\nof the same color! That's the first step...
EventBattleM002_06_M	It's easy! Once the table is full of plates,\nthey'll shoot off automatically!
EventBattleM002_07_M	Although, that's not the only way to attack.
EventBattleM002_08_M	After eating sushi, touch a {c[ffcc2f]}stack of plates{c[000000]}\nand {c[ffcc2f]}slide it upward{c[000000]} to throw it!
EventBattleM002_10_M	There you go! You can shoot plates stacked\non the table whenever you want!
EventBattleM002_11_M	Hit the enemy with {c[ffcc2f]}stacks of the same-\ncolored plates{c[000000]} for a superpowerful {c[5fd871]}combo{c[000000]}!
EventBattleM002_12_M	Yeah, yeah, so you figured out how to shoot\nplates. Too bad it won't help!
EventBattleM002_13_M	{s[150]}EAT THIS!{s[100]}
EventBattleM002_15_M	Good eye! You can shoot plates stacked on\nyour table whenever you want!
EventBattleM002_16_M	If you hit them with {c[ffcc2f]}multiple stacks of the\nsame color{c[000000]}, it makes a powerful {c[5fd871]}combo{c[000000]}!
EventBattleM002_17_M	But you don't have to do everything yourself.\nTry stacking more plates without shooting!
EventBattleM002_19_M	There you go! Once the table is full of plates,\nthey'll shoot off automatically!

CharaSerif_01_M	Woohoo! Just a little further to the village!
CharaSerif_01_F	Woohoo! Just a little further to the village!
CharaSerif_02_M	Careful. Don't overexcite yourself and get\na cramp.
CharaSerif_03_M	{s[150]}Aha! It's Franklin!{s[100]}
CharaSerif_04_M	Why is the Empire here?!
CharaSerif_04_F	Why is the Empire here?!
CharaSerif_05_M	I don't know, but you should find\nsomewhere to hide.
CharaSerif_06_M	So you're the guy, huh? I don't know why\nwe care... You look pretty scrawny to me.
CharaSerif_07_M	Well, what a surprise. An Imperial general\npersonally leading the hunt for me?
CharaSerif_08_M	My reps precede me, huh? Well, ain't\nthat something!
CharaSerif_09_M	{s[150]}Hah! You're rightâ€”it's me...{s[100]}
CharaSerif_10_M	The most ripped general in the whole\nImperial Army, the one and only Kodiak!
CharaSerif_11_M	All sushi sprites belong to the Empire!\nYou can't just waltz around with one!
CharaSerif_12_M	Hand over that Ara-o and nobody has\nto get bruised!
CharaSerif_13_M	Alas... I won't be parting with Ara-o until\nI've fulfilled my dream.
CharaSerif_14_M	Besides which, I doubt he would want\nto leave me anyway.
CharaSerif_15_M	Yeah! I'm with Franklin! Whatever your\nEmpire wants me to do, I want none of it!
CharaSerif_16_M	Of course. You could have made this easy,\nflab-brains, but we can do it the other way.
CharaSerif_17_M	{s[150]}Go for it, men! Hit 'em hard!{s[100]}
CharaSerif_18_M	Urgh... Such cruelty...
CharaSerif_19_M	{s[150]}Hah! What'd you expect?!{s[100]}
CharaSerif_20_M	Franklin! Are you OK?!
CharaSerif_20_F	Franklin! Are you OK?!
CharaSerif_21_M	Huh? Who's the kid?
CharaSerif_21_F	Huh? Who's the kid?
CharaSerif_22_M	M-Musashi... You're just in time!
CharaSerif_24_M	You must use my power! Make a stand\nagainst the Empire!
CharaSerif_25_M	You want ME to fight THEM? How?!
CharaSerif_25_F	You want ME to fight THEM? How?!
CharaSerif_26_M	Eat my sushi. Then you can attack by\nthrowing the empty plates!
CharaSerif_27_M	Well, if I have to! Bring it on!
CharaSerif_27_F	Well, if I have to! Bring it on!
\event\eventEndM001.msbt
CharaSerif_10_M	Hahahah! It's always satisfying to see\nsomeone take their first taste of sushi.
CharaSerif_11_M	Wow... Thank you. Sushi is so amazing\nthat I think I might cry!
CharaSerif_11_F	Wow... Thank you. Sushi is so amazing\nthat I think I might cry!
CharaSerif_12_M	{s[150]}Yep! There I go!{s[100]}
CharaSerif_12_F	{s[150]}Yep! There I go!{s[100]}
CharaSerif_13_M	Tears of joy, huh? Humans are so strange!
CharaSerif_14_M	Quiet, you sushi spout!
CharaSerif_14_F	Quiet, you sushi spout!
CharaSerif_15_M	{s[150]}What'd you call me?!{s[100]}
CharaSerif_16_M	Hmm... That's an interesting jacket.
CharaSerif_17_M	You like it? My dad gave it to me when\nI was a kid.
CharaSerif_17_F	You like it? My dad gave it to me when\nI was a kid.
CharaSerif_18_M	From your dad, is it?
CharaSerif_18_F	From your dad, is it?
CharaSerif_19_M	Yeah, but he and my mom disappeared\nright after the Struggles started...
CharaSerif_19_F	Yeah, but he and my mom disappeared\nright after the Struggles started...
CharaSerif_20_M	That is unfortunate. But seeing you eat\nhas convinced me of one thing.
CharaSerif_22_M	You ought to have this.
CharaSerif_23_M	You got {c[91ff1e]}a weird thingy{c[000000]}!
CharaSerif_24_M	What is it?
CharaSerif_24_F	What is it?
CharaSerif_25_M	Haha... That would be telling. But I think\nyou'll find a use for it.
CharaSerif_26_M	This all seems kinda fishy.\nWho are you REALLY?
CharaSerif_26_F	This all seems kinda fishy.\nWho are you REALLY?
CharaSerif_27_M	If you must know... I'm a traveling\nsushi striker.
CharaSerif_28_M	I've never heard of that.
CharaSerif_28_F	I've never heard of that.
CharaSerif_29_M	They pledge with sushi sprites and summon\nsushi's awesome powers.
CharaSerif_30_M	Some of that means doing battle with\nsushi, so they're called sushi strikers!
CharaSerif_32_M	There are not many nowadays with access\nto sushi.
CharaSerif_33_M	Don't you think that's a shame?
CharaSerif_34_M	Wouldn't it be wonderful if everyone could\nhave sushi, regardless of circumstance?
CharaSerif_35_M	{s[150]}Whoa! That's a tall order!{s[100]}
CharaSerif_36_M	Maybe so, but I'm achieving it in my\ntravels, one person at a time.
CharaSerif_37_M	(Sushi for...everyone? That has to\nhappen! It's too good to keep secret!)
CharaSerif_37_F	(Sushi for...everyone? That has to\nhappen! It's too good to keep secret!)
CharaSerif_38_M	Hey, so... Franklin...
CharaSerif_38_F	Hey, so... Franklin...
CharaSerif_39_M	Yes, Musashi?
CharaSerif_40_M	You should come to my village next!\nThe other orphans are going hungry!
CharaSerif_40_F	You should come to my village next!\nThe other orphans are going hungry!
CharaSerif_41_M	I wanna see their faces when they get\nto try sushi too!
CharaSerif_41_F	I wanna see their faces when they get\nto try sushi too!
CharaSerif_43_M	Then that can be my next stop. Let's go\nspread the good word of sushi!

homeArena_cmn_out_01_M	Come by anytime you wanna test\nyour strength!
homeArena_cmn_in_01_M	Sup, Musashi! Welcome to the Arena!
homeArena_01_01_M	Welcome to the Arena, where you can take\non other strikers in {c[ffcc2f]}multiplayer {c[000000]}sushi battles!
homeArena_01_02_M	Just to make sure we have a fair fight here...
homeArena_01_03_M	Whatever you were at before, here we set\nyou and your sushi sprites to level {c[ffcc2f]}30{c[000000]}!
homeArena_01_04_M	Got your Sprite Order all set?\nThen here we go!
homeArena_02_01_M	Welcome to the Arena! You're up for\na multiplayer battle, right?!
homeArena_02_02_M	Oops... {c[ffcc2f]}All three of your sushi sprite sets\n{c[000000]}have {c[ffcc2f]}a sprite you can't use here{c[000000]}.
homeArena_02_03_M	Hmm, I guess I have to turn you away.\nSorry 'bout that...
homeArena_02_04_M	Maybe you could go into {c[91ff1e]}Sprite Order{c[000000]} and\ntake out the sushi sprites you can't use?
homeArena_03_01_M	So it's a Tasteful Battle you want!\nNo tricks, no gimmicks, just sushi!
homeArena_04_01_M	What kinda battle are you in the mood for?
homeArena_05_01_M	A Tasteful Battle it is! And who are you\nthinking of fighting with?
homeArena_05_02_M	A Chaos Battle it is! And who are you\nthinking of fighting with?
homeArena_06_01_M	So which do you want, a {c[91ff1e]}Local Battle{c[000000]}\nor an {c[91ff1e]}Online Battle{c[000000]}?
homeArena_07_01_M	You can have a {c[91ff1e]}Random Match{c[000000]} or a\n{c[91ff1e]}Buddy Match{c[000000]}! It's your call!
homeArena_08_01_M	Oh yeah! I meant to tell you! I'm fixing to\nexpand the Arena.
homeArena_08_02_M	Huh?! Is it not big enough or something?
homeArena_08_03_M	Well, I thought it was! But I've been hearing\nmore and more from the SLF folks...
homeArena_08_04_M	They're all telling me that battles where you\nget to use {c[ffae00]}capsules {c[000000]}are way better!
homeArena_08_05_M	Well... I don't know if I'd go that far...
homeArena_08_06_M	Oh, this won't take long! And once I'm done,\nyou can have fights with capsules here!
homeArena_08_07_M	All finished! Now you can have those fights\nwhere you see {c[ffcc2f]}capsules{c[000000]} all the time.
homeArena_08_08_M	I think I'll call 'em {c[91ff1e]}Chaos Battles{c[000000]}! Enjoy!
homeArena_09_01_M	Guess what, Musashi! That's right! It's time\nto expand the Arena again!
homeArena_09_02_M	You didn't even let me guess!
homeArena_09_03_M	See, I've been getting a lotta requests\nfrom the SLF folks again.
homeArena_09_04_M	All anyone wants now is to try these new\nOnline Battles!
homeArena_09_05_M	I don't know what that is.
homeArena_09_06_M	That's why I'm gonna set 'em up! So you\ncan find out for yourself!
homeArena_09_07_M	They say you can fight all sorts of people,\nfrom all over, right here!
homeArena_09_08_M	Anyway, that's {c[91ff1e]}Online Battles{c[000000]}.\nWe can do those now!
homeArena_10_01_M	Well now... If it isn't Musashi.
homeArena_10_02_M	Purrsilla?! You're at the Arena? Are you\nhere to fight me?!
homeArena_10_03_M	Perish the thought. No, I simply found\ncivilian life too tedious.
homeArena_10_04_M	But here, as master of the arena, I get all\nsorts of delicious excitement.
homeArena_10_05_M	But you're here to fight, yes? Then a fight\nyou shall have! Welcome to the Arena!
homeArena_11_01_M	Welcome to the Arena!
homeArena_12_01_M	Oh dear. {c[ffcc2f]}All three of your sushi sprite sets\n{c[000000]}have a sprite {c[ffcc2f]}forbidden here in the Arena{c[000000]}.
homeArena_12_02_M	I can't allow you into battles as things\nstand. So sorry.
homeArena_12_03_M	I've an idea. Perhaps you could remove any\nforbidden multiplayer sprites in {c[91ff1e]}Sprite Order{c[000000]}.
homeArena_13_01_M	Ahaha... Come and fight again. I'll be here!
homeArena_14_01_M	Which did you have in mind? A {c[91ff1e]}Local Battle{c[000000]}\nor {c[91ff1e]}Online Battle{c[000000]}?
homeArena_15_01_M	What's your preference? A {c[91ff1e]}Random Match{c[000000]}\nor a {c[91ff1e]}Buddy Match{c[000000]}?
homeArena_16_01_M	And which rules will you be selecting?
homeArena_17_01_M	Is there someone in particular you wanted\nto face off against in a Tasteful Battle?
homeArena_17_02_M	Is there someone in particular you wanted\nto face off against in a Chaos Battle?

homeKoziin_first_05_M	Make yourself at home!
homeKoziin_first_06_M	That's right! I almost forgot.
homeKoziin_first_07_M	If you have a {c[91ff1e]}Party Charm{c[000000]} in your inventory,\nyou can have a sushi party!
homeKoziin_first_08_M	Everyone, even sushi sprites,\nshould be happy.
homeKoziin_cmn_repeat_01_M	Welcome home!
homeKoziin_cmn_ret_01_M	What's on your mind?
homeKoziin_cmn_btn_party_M	Let's have a sushi party!
homeKoziin_cmn_btn_party_F	Let's have a sushi party!
homeKoziin_cmn_btn_healthy_M	How are you?
homeKoziin_select_00_M	Sweet! Which sushi sprite should I\ninvite to the party?
homeKoziin_select_01_M	Whoo hoo! We're having a sushi party!\n{c[91ff1e]}\x0e\x01\x0d\0{c[000000]}, take it away!
homeKoziin_select_02_M	You had a sushi party with the kids!
homeKoziin_select_03_M	Thanks for the food, \x0e\x01\x0d\0!
homeKoziin_select_lv00_00_M	I appreciate the thought, Musashi. Look at\nall these full bellies and happy smiles.
homeKoziin_select_lv01_00_M	Thanks a ton!
homeKoziin_select_lv02_02_M	Thank you!
homeKoziin_select_lv03_00_M	Thanks for helping. This means a lot,\nMusashi.
homeKoziin_select_lv03_01_M	This means a lot. I'm so thankful for you,\nMusashi. So are the kids.
homeKoziin_select_lv03_02_M	Thanks as usual, Musashi.\nWe all really appreciate it.
homeKoziin_select_lv04_00_M	Musashi, it's not just the kids you saved.\nYou saved me, too. Thank you.
homeKoziin_select_lv04_01_M	Seriously, thank you. Because of you,\nI'm not alone anymore.
homeKoziin_select_lv04_02_M	I'm so grateful to have met you.\nThank you.
homeKoziin_select_fruit_00_M	All of the kids had such a good time.\nAnd so did I!
homeKoziin_select_fruit_01_M	Thanks for thinking about the kids while\nfighting this war. Don't you ever get tired?
homeKoziin_select_fruit_02_M	Hmmm... If only there was something\nthat I could do to help you.
homeKoziin_select_fruit_03_M	That's right! Take my sushi sprite, Pyonten,\nwith you!
homeKoziin_select_fruit_04_M	The sushi sprite {c[91ff1e]}Pyonten{c[000000]} has joined you! \nIts skill is {c[91ff1e]}Fruit Paradise{c[000000]}!
homeKoziin_select_fruit_05_M	Hahaha! With {c[91ff1e]}Fruit Paradise{c[000000]}, you can\nheal and attack at the same time.
homeKoziin_select_fruit_06_M	Pyonten is yours. But promise me one thing.
homeKoziin_select_fruit_07_M	Keep him safe. And when you finish the fight,\ncome back home!
homeKoziin_healthy_cmn_M	Hey, everyone. How are you?\nDoing well?
homeKoziin_healthy_lv00_M	Yes! They're happy that you came to visit!
homeKoziin_healthy_lv03_M	Yes, thank you!
homeKoziin_useful_first_00_M	That's right, I was going to tell you what I\nlearned about battling in the Empire.
homeKoziin_useful_first_01_M	Musashi, this tidbit will definitely help you\nin your fight.
homeKoziin_useful_first_02_M	Oh!
homeKoziin_useful_first_03_M	You can use a {c[91ff1e]}Skill Charm{c[000000]} on a sushi\nsprite to raise its skill level.
homeKoziin_useful_first_04_M	When the skill level increases, its effects get\nstronger, or its gauge fills faster!
homeKoziin_useful_first_05_M	Although, Skill Charms are very rare, so\nchoose carefully where you use them.
homeKoziin_useful_cmn_M	That's rightâ€”I had some more information\nfor you.
homeKoziin_useful_00_01_M	You can level up sushi sprites by\nusing {c[91ff1e]}EXP Charms{c[000000]} on them.
homeKoziin_useful_00_02_M	Large charms have a lot of\nexperience points in them.
homeKoziin_useful_00_03_M	So you can use them to level up a sushi\nsprite that you want to use immediately.
homeKoziin_useful_01_00_M	Skills for attacking, like {c[91ff1e]}Sushi Bonanza{c[000000]},\nare more powerful during a sushi jubilee.
homeKoziin_useful_01_01_M	But using a healing skill like {c[91ff1e]}Sweets Paradise{c[000000]}\nduring a sushi jubilee is a bit of a waste.
homeKoziin_useful_02_00_M	It's fine to save healing skills for when\nyour HP is low.
homeKoziin_useful_02_01_M	But I recommend using them before\nyou find yourself in a pinch.
homeKoziin_useful_02_02_M	If you use them while you still have time, then\ntheir gauge will start filling again right away.
homeKoziin_useful_03_00_M	For skills that have a set time,\nlike {c[91ff1e]}Hidden Plates{c[000000]}...
homeKoziin_useful_03_01_M	The sushi gauge won't start filling again\nuntil the skill has completely finished.
homeKoziin_useful_03_02_M	But if it's a skill with an immediate effect,\nthen the gauge will start to refill right away!
homeKoziin_useful_04_00_M	If you have sushi sprites that produce\nsimilar types of sushi...
homeKoziin_useful_04_01_M	You should put them next to each\nother on the {c[91ff1e]}Sprite Order screen{c[000000]}.
homeKoziin_useful_04_02_M	That will make the sushi much easier\nto link!
homeKoziin_useful_05_00_M	You'll become very powerful if you can\ncombine skills effectively.
homeKoziin_useful_05_01_M	For example, if you combine {c[91ff1e]}Sushi Bonanza{c[000000]},\nand {c[91ff1e]}Electrozap{c[000000]}, the effects are lethal!
homeKoziin_useful_05_02_M	On the other hand, {c[91ff1e]}Sushi Bonanza{c[000000]} and\n{c[91ff1e]}Sweets Paradise{c[000000]} don't go too well together.
homeKoziin_useful_06_00_M	All of the sushi sprite skills can be\ncombined for a multiplying effect.
homeKoziin_useful_06_01_M	For example, if you use {c[91ff1e]}Runaway Lanes{c[000000]}\nand {c[91ff1e]}Double-Edged Lanes{c[000000]} at the same time...
homeKoziin_useful_06_02_M	Then the resulting effect will cause your\nopponent's lanes to hit an incredible speed!
homeKoziin_useful_07_00_M	Let's talk fruit for a second.
homeKoziin_useful_07_01_M	It does double duty. Eat it to restore HP,\nthen shoot the plates to deal damage!
homeKoziin_useful_07_02_M	Sushi sprites who produce a lot of fruit have\nan advantage for that reason.
homeKoziin_useful_08_00_M	There are skills that make your opponent\npanic, tripping them up in battle.
homeKoziin_useful_08_01_M	{c[91ff1e]}Runaway Lanes{c[000000]} is an easy one to send your\nopponent into a panic!
homeKoziin_useful_09_00_M	All sushi strikers shout a skill's name\nbefore using it.
homeKoziin_useful_09_01_M	If you listen closely, you can hear the skill\nbefore your opponent unleashes it.
homeKoziin_useful_09_02_M	For example, if your opponent uses {c[91ff1e]}Sweets\nParadise{c[000000]}, use {c[91ff1e]}Runaway Lanes{c[000000]} to undo it!
homeKoziin_useful_10_00_M	Some raw powers are activated using\na skill.
homeKoziin_useful_10_01_M	Set up a combination well to make your\nskills even more powerful!
homeKoziin_useful_11_00_M	The effect times for skills are noted in\ntheir explanations.
homeKoziin_useful_11_01_M	But while the skills are active, the skill gauge\nwill show you how long they'll last.
homeKoziin_useful_11_02_M	Look at your opponent's gauge to see\nhow much longer an obstacle skill will last.
homeKoziin_useful_12_00_M	Gears can be powerful tools because they\nmake sushi flow even faster.
homeKoziin_useful_12_01_M	But {c[91ff1e]}Runaway Lanes {c[000000]}might speed things up\ntoo much for you to even make a move!
homeKoziin_useful_12_02_M	You might also want to change gears based\non your preference or your opponent's skills.
homeKoziin_useful_13_00_M	{c[91ff1e]}Runaway Lanes{c[000000]} does more than simply\nspeed up your opponent's sushi.
homeKoziin_useful_13_01_M	You can also use it to flush away\ntheir sweets.
homeKoziin_useful_13_02_M	{c[91ff1e]}Double-Edged Lanes {c[000000]}has a similar effect.\nPretty treacherous, wouldn't you say?
homeKoziin_useful_14_00_M	If an enemy uses a powerful single attack\nskill like {c[91ff1e]}Electrozap{c[000000]} on you...
homeKoziin_useful_14_01_M	You should use a defensive skill like\n{c[91ff1e]}Sushi Shield{c[000000]} to dull its effects.
homeKoziin_useful_14_02_M	Use this approach with even more\npowerful offensive or defensive skills.
homeKoziin_useful_15_00_M	Sushi parties seem to make everyone happy,\nincluding the sushi sprite who is hosting.
homeKoziin_useful_15_01_M	In fact, sushi parties strengthen your\nfriendships with sushi sprites.
homeKoziin_useful_15_02_M	Better friendships means better benefits\nin battle. It's win-win!
homeKoziin_useful_16_00_M	Did you know that lanes speed up a bit\nduring sushi jubilee?
homeKoziin_useful_16_01_M	So if someone uses {c[91ff1e]}Runaway Lanes {c[000000]}during\nsushi jubilee while you use a gear...
homeKoziin_useful_16_02_M	Things can get crazy! When that happens,\nit's best to wait for the gear's effect to stop.
homeKoziin_return_lv00_M	Thank you! Please feel free to come\nback anytime!
homeKoziin_return_lv02_M	Take care, and don't be a stranger, OK?
homeKoziin_return_lv04_M	I'll see you again!

homeShrine_first_rank_00_M	What's a "{c[91ff1e]}striker rank{c[000000]}"?
homeShrine_first_rank_01_M	As the name suggests, it shows how\nstrong of a sushi striker you are.
homeShrine_first_rank_02_M	When your rank goes up, you can\npledge with more sushi sprites.
homeShrine_first_rank_03_M	Also, you'll receive fun new items to\ncelebrate your new rank!
homeShrine_first_rank_04_M	Wow! That sounds amazing! How do I\nincrease my rank?!
homeShrine_first_rank_04_F	Wow! That sounds amazing! How do I\nincrease my rank?!

homeShrine_rank_00_M	I'd like to raise my {c[91ff1e]}striker rank{c[000000]}!

homeShrine_rank_04_M	Well then, please take this {c[91ff1e]}\x0e\x01\x0b\0\n{c[000000]}as a reward for raising your rank.
homeShrine_rank_06_M	Musashi, it seems you haven't completed\nthe {c[ffcc2f]}Triumphs necessary to raise your rank{c[000000]}.
homeShrine_rank_07_M	Well then, check the {c[91ff1e]}Secret Scroll{c[000000]}, complete\nany unfulfilled {c[ffcc2f]}Triumphs{c[000000]}, and return here.

homeShrine_word_02B_M	Ah!
homeShrine_word_03_M	Here's your {c[91ff1e]}divine order{c[000000]}!

homeShrine_word_08_M	Your {c[91ff1e]}divine order {c[000000]}doesn't seem to exist.
homeShrine_word_09_M	Musashi, it doesn't look like there's any\n{c[91ff1e]}divine order {c[000000]}under that name.
homeShrine_first_out_01_M	Musashi! Please take this!
homeShrine_first_out_02_M	You got a {c[91ff1e]}Potential Plate{c[000000]}!
homeShrine_first_out_03_M	Um... A Potential Plate?
homeShrine_first_out_04_M	Yes. This plate was separated from its\nholder when the Empire retreated.
homeShrine_first_out_05_M	Set this as your {c[91ff1e]}prepared item{c[000000]}, and\nthen start a sushi battle.
homeShrine_first_out_06_M	If you prove yourself worthy, the sushi sprite\nin this plate might pledge itself to you.
homeShrine_first_out_07_M	Also, do remember that your striker rank is\njust as important as your battle results.
homeShrine_first_out_08_M	Musashi, if anyone can do it, it's you!

homeSushibar_cmn_out_01_M	All right, come again!
homeSushibar_cmn_ret_01_M	Make yourself at home!
homeSushibar_cmn_repeat_01_M	That's all I got for you now.\nI'll keep on digging for good dirt!
homeSushibar_cmn_btn_01_M	Hear anything interesting lately?
homeSushibar_00_in_01_M	Musashi! Musashi!
homeSushibar_00_in_02_M	Archie! How's it going with the...\nsushi...store?
homeSushibar_00_in_02_F	Archie! How's it going with the...\nsushi...store?
homeSushibar_00_in_03_M	It's going good! Word's getting out there\nabout us.
homeSushibar_00_in_04_M	I'll let you know if anyone who comes in\nlets something good slip.
homeSushibar_00_in_05_M	I'm thinking of building other stuff here too!\nWait 'til you see what I got in mind!
homeSushibar_00_in_06_M	This place isn't enough for you?!
homeSushibar_00_in_06_F	This place isn't enough for you?!
homeSushibar_00_in_07_M	Not even close! We already got the\n{c[91ff1e]}Sushi Sprite Shrine {c[000000]}and the {c[91ff1e]}Arena {c[000000]}going!
homeSushibar_00_in_08_M	You're off for the border, right? You oughtta\nstop by the shrine and pray for victory!
homeSushibar_00_in_09_M	Huh, so there's a {c[91ff1e]}Sushi Sprite Shrine{c[000000]} here.\nI'll go check it out!
homeSushibar_00_in_09_F	Huh, so there's a {c[91ff1e]}Sushi Sprite Shrine{c[000000]} here.\nI'll go check it out!
homeSushibar_00_in_10_M	Best of luck, buddy!
homeSushibar_01_in_01_M	What's up, Musashi? Glad you came!
homeSushibar_01_cmn_01_M	I GOTTA tell you what I overheard\nfrom the customers!
homeSushibar_01_a_01_M	If your Striker Rank goes up, you can get\nall kinds of lane-drive gears!
homeSushibar_01_a_02_M	Plus, sushi sprites with sweet skills will up\nand ask you to pledge with them!
homeSushibar_01_a_03_M	There'll be an "{c[ffae00]}!{c[000000]}" at the Shrine when you're\nready to rank up, so keep your eyes peeled.
homeSushibar_01_b_01_M	I did pick up on one way to get a good\nrank in the results after a battle.
homeSushibar_01_b_02_M	It's usually good if your finishing attack\ndoes a load of damage!
homeSushibar_01_b_03_M	And if you can win without using too many\nskills, that works in your favor too.
homeSushibar_01_c_01_M	Let's see...
homeSushibar_01_c_02_M	Oh! Kyatten had something to say to you!
homeSushibar_01_c_03_M	I am Kyatten, one of the many sushi\nsprites who control the flow of sushi.
homeSushibar_01_c_04_M	I keep the sushi gate in this restaurant open\nso that all who enter may have sushi.
homeSushibar_01_c_05_M	Their happiness becomes mine. I'm told\nI have you to thank for that, Musashi.
homeSushibar_02_in_01_M	Hey, Musashi! Listen up!
homeSushibar_02_a_01_M	I heard something from one of the\ncustomers that I just had to pass on!
homeSushibar_02_a_02_M	There's hidden stages in every area that\ntake some doing to get to!
homeSushibar_02_a_03_M	What you need is {c[ffae00]}lots of â˜… marks{c[000000]} after\n{c[ffae00]}clearing {c[000000]}the area before you can get to 'em.
homeSushibar_02_a_04_M	Imagining what you could dig up there gives\nme goosebumps. Tell me if you find one!
homeSushibar_03_in_01_M	Yo, Musashi! How's it going?
homeSushibar_03_in_02_M	Y'think it's true that getting {c[ffcc2f]}lots of â˜…s{c[000000]} and\n{c[ffcc2f]}clearing {c[000000]}an area will reveal a {c[ffcc2f]}secret stage{c[000000]}?
homeSushibar_03_cmn_01_M	I might as well tell you the other thing\nI heard from my customers...
homeSushibar_03_a_01_M	Somewhere, deep in the secret stages,\nthere's a shrine with a rare sushi sprite!
homeSushibar_03_a_02_M	Watch it, though. The Imperials looking into\n'em have some kinda weird sushi sprites.
homeSushibar_03_a_03_M	They might be a whole different fight from\nwhat you're used to. Stay on your toes!
homeSushibar_03_b_01_M	The good news is it's no problem to get\nahold of {c[91ff1e]}Renewal Beans{c[000000]} in secret stages.
homeSushibar_03_b_02_M	If the road ahead gets too tough to tackle,\ntry some secret stages for a while.
homeSushibar_03_b_03_M	After all, loading up on {c[91ff1e]}Renewal Beans{c[000000]}\ncan never hurt!
homeSushibar_03_c_01_M	I feel like there was something else...
homeSushibar_03_c_02_M	Right! Kyatten wanted to chat!
homeSushibar_03_c_03_M	I've heard that you've made yourself\ninvaluable, Musashi.
homeSushibar_03_c_04_M	You have the {c[91ff1e]}Secret Scroll{c[000000]}, hrrrrm?\nThe {c[ffcc2f]}Advanced Tactics {c[000000]}it contains...
homeSushibar_03_c_05_M	A mystic scribe wrote that to preserve the\nsecrets handed down between strikers.
homeSushibar_03_c_06_M	It's through their magic that the scroll\nmentions you by name here and there.
homeSushibar_04_in_01_M	Musashi!
homeSushibar_04_in_02_M	I'm feeling like the time has come to\nexpand this place!
homeSushibar_04_in_03_M	With more room in here, you might get to\ntalk to my customers directly!
homeSushibar_04_in_04_M	That'd be a nice change of pace!
homeSushibar_04_in_04_F	That'd be a nice change of pace!
homeSushibar_04_in_05_M	There's just one thing that worries me.
homeSushibar_04_in_07_M	If this place gets any busier, Kyatten might\nnot be able to keep up with demand.
homeSushibar_04_in_08_M	Yeah, I see your point.
homeSushibar_04_in_08_F	Yeah, I see your point.
homeSushibar_04_in_09_M	But I already know a solution! I found it in\nsome old books I picked up on a dig.
homeSushibar_04_in_10_M	There's these {c[91ff1e]}Mysterious Stones{c[000000]} near the\nsea that boost a sushi sprite's power.
homeSushibar_04_in_11_M	Feel like going on a treasure hunt for 'em?\nI figure I won't need more than {c[ffcc2f]}three{c[000000]}!
homeSushibar_04_in_12_M	Sure thing! I'll be back here as soon as\nI find a few!
homeSushibar_04_in_12_F	Sure thing! I'll be back here as soon as\nI find a few!
homeSushibar_04_in_13_M	Awesome! Well, I'll leave you to it!
homeSushibar_05_in_01_M	Yo, Musashi! Glad you're here!
homeSushibar_05_cmn_01_M	I've got a doozy of a rumor to share!\nI picked this up from the customers.
homeSushibar_05_a_01_M	One of 'em saw some {c[91ff1e]}Mysterious Stone{c[000000]}\nnear the Republic border.
homeSushibar_05_a_02_M	Y'think it's a sign of one of those\n{c[ffcc2f]}hidden stages{c[000000]}?
homeSushibar_05_b_01_M	What else was there...
homeSushibar_05_b_02_M	Oh! Kyatten wanted to talk to you too!
homeSushibar_05_b_03_M	Greetings, Musashi. So...you are embarking\non a search for {c[91ff1e]}Mysterious Stones{c[000000]}?
homeSushibar_05_b_04_M	That would be helpful. We sushi sprites can\nonly produce so much sushi purr day...
homeSushibar_05_c_01_M	Yeah, and word's getting around! Folks are\nstarting to come here from all over!
homeSushibar_05_c_02_M	The more peeps we can feed, the more word\nspreads, and the further they'll come!
homeSushibar_05_c_03_M	And you know what that meansâ€”rumors\nfrom even deeper in Imperial turf!
homeSushibar_05_btn_01_M	I brought three {c[91ff1e]}Mysterious Stones{c[000000]}!
homeSushibar_05_btn_01_F	I brought three {c[91ff1e]}Mysterious Stones{c[000000]}!
homeSushibar_05_stone_01_M	Way to go! I knew you'd deliver!
homeSushibar_05_stone_02_M	Heheh. It was a piece of cake!
homeSushibar_05_stone_02_F	Heheh. It was a piece of cake!
homeSushibar_05_stone_03_M	But what is this thing, anyway? Someone\ncarved a weird-looking shape into it.
homeSushibar_05_stone_03_F	But what is this thing, anyway? Someone\ncarved a weird-looking shape into it.
homeSushibar_05_stone_04_M	Yeah, see, about that... No one carved it!\nIt got that way naturally!
homeSushibar_05_stone_05_M	What?! That happens?
homeSushibar_05_stone_05_F	What?! That happens?
homeSushibar_05_stone_06_M	Yeah, all the time! Something in the sea does\nit, which is weird. Nothing lives there, right?
homeSushibar_05_stone_07_M	Well, I've heard there's bugs and stuff in\nthere. But I don't know if that's true.
homeSushibar_05_stone_07_F	Well, I've heard there's bugs and stuff in\nthere. But I don't know if that's true.
homeSushibar_05_stone_08_M	Turns out, a long time ago, the sea was\nfull of animals.
homeSushibar_05_stone_09_M	Wow. Wild!
homeSushibar_05_stone_09_F	Wow. Wild!
homeSushibar_05_stone_10_M	This rock here was formed from one of\nthose sea animals a long, long time ago.
homeSushibar_05_stone_11_M	You're rocking my world here, Archie.
homeSushibar_05_stone_11_F	You're rocking my world here, Archie.
homeSushibar_05_stone_12_M	Well, enough talk about ancient times.\nI'm gonna get started expanding this place!
homeSushibar_05_stone_14_M	Whaddaya think? Pretty soon, we're gonna\nbe rolling in customers!
homeSushibar_05_stone_15_M	Come back in a while, and who knows what\nkindsa rumors we'll have for you?
homeSushibar_06_in_01_M	Yo, Musashi! It's been a minute!
homeSushibar_06_a_01_M	I owe you one! Now that the restaurant's\nexpanded, the customers are rolling in!
homeSushibar_06_a_02_M	It used to be so crowded that I couldn't\nmove, so I could only pass on what I heard.
homeSushibar_06_a_03_M	But with the space we got now, you can\ntalk to the customers yourself!
homeSushibar_06_b_01_M	Wanna go hear what they have to say?\nC'mon!
homeSushibar_06_b_02_M	Are you OK?! I got worried when I heard\nyou were taking on the Empire alone.
homeSushibar_06_b_03_M	But Masa said the best way to deal with a kid\nyour age is to let them have their way.
homeSushibar_06_b_04_M	But I think if he was willing to give you such\nan important job, he must depend on you!
homeSushibar_06_c_01_M	You wanna go see what the customers\nhave to say?
homeSushibar_06_c_02_M	{s[150]}CHAAAARGE!{s[100]}
homeSushibar_06_c_03_M	Whoops, sorry about that. I just got my own\ncommand, so I'm practicing giving orders.
homeSushibar_06_c_04_M	My real problem is sushi, though. The stuff\nI eat during battle is...kinda rough...
homeSushibar_07_in_01_M	Yo, Musashi! I got some juicy info!
homeSushibar_07_a_01_M	Thanks for meeting up with me! There's\nsome SLF-only news to share!
homeSushibar_07_a_02_M	Out in the Imperial Rim, there's this engineer\nwho's an expert on lane-drive gears!
homeSushibar_07_a_03_M	And it gets better! All they need to make an\nultimate gear is some {c[91ff1e]}weird round rock{c[000000]}.
homeSushibar_07_a_04_M	What?! No kidding?!
homeSushibar_07_a_04_F	What?! No kidding?!
homeSushibar_07_a_05_M	Would I mess around about something like\nthis? It could be huge!
homeSushibar_07_a_06_M	If you come across any {c[91ff1e]}weird round rocks{c[000000]},\nthat ultimate lane-drive gear could be yours!
homeSushibar_07_a_07_M	If I see any {c[91ff1e]}weird round rocks{c[000000]}, I promise\nyou'll be the first to know!
homeSushibar_07_a_07_F	If I see any {c[91ff1e]}weird round rocks{c[000000]}, I promise\nyou'll be the first to know!
homeSushibar_08_in_01_M	Yo, Musashi! Good to see ya!
homeSushibar_08_cmn_01_M	I got another tip from the customers for ya...
homeSushibar_08_a_01_M	That {c[91ff1e]}weird round rock{c[000000]} I told you about has\na flower shape on it. It's real pretty, I hear.
homeSushibar_08_a_02_M	The guy who was describing it said he saw\nsome shady-seeming dude carrying the rock.
homeSushibar_08_b_01_M	Hey! Did I ever tell you how I met Kyatten?
homeSushibar_08_b_02_M	During all the commotion when the Empire\npulled out of the Republic...
homeSushibar_08_b_03_M	The soldiers trying to make off with the\ntreasure here threw out a lucky cat statue.
homeSushibar_08_b_04_M	You know me, I'll take any luck I can get,\nso I dove in to catch it! Turned out...
homeSushibar_08_b_05_M	The bottom of the statue was actually a\npledge plate, and wham! There's Kyatten!
homeSushibar_08_b_06_M	Me and Kyatten have been tight ever since.\nPretty good story, huh?
homeSushibar_08_btn_01_M	I found that {c[91ff1e]}weird round rock{c[000000]}!
homeSushibar_08_btn_01_F	I found that {c[91ff1e]}weird round rock{c[000000]}!
homeSushibar_08_stone_01_M	Cool! It sure is weird...and round.\nThey don't call it that for nothing, huh?
homeSushibar_08_stone_03_M	Nice! Lemme mark where I've heard the\nImperial Rim is supposed to be on your map!
homeSushibar_08_stone_04_M	Thanks, Archie! I'll head out right now!
homeSushibar_08_stone_04_F	Thanks, Archie! I'll head out right now!
homeSushibar_08_stone_05_M	Take care, buddy!
homeSushibar_09_in_01_M	Musashi! Good timing!
homeSushibar_09_cmn_01_M	Plenty of good info for ya today.
homeSushibar_09_a_01_M	Sure, yeah.
homeSushibar_09_a_02_M	Kyatten has a thing or two to say!
homeSushibar_09_a_03_M	Have a seat, Musashi. Those {c[91ff1e]}Mysterious\nStones{c[000000]} you found are verrry interesting.
homeSushibar_09_a_04_M	When I am near them, I feel memories of\nold powers flowing through me. Hohoh...
homeSushibar_09_a_05_M	I do believe it's having a soothing effect\non the stiffness in my shoulder.
homeSushibar_09_b_01_M	Now that that's out of the way...\nLet's hear from some customers!
homeSushibar_09_b_02_M	Back in the Empire, sometimes we'd see\na strange man here and there.
homeSushibar_09_b_03_M	I spoke to him once, and he said he was\nlooking for something called "soosh."
homeSushibar_09_b_04_M	Apart from that, all he talked about was\nsome nonsense about his "bempty."
homeSushibar_09_c_01_M	Yo! Y'know the zappy lightning symbols you\nsee in capsules sometimes?
homeSushibar_09_c_02_M	I found out that the bigger the link you have\nwhen you take it, the more damage it does!
homeSushibar_09_c_03_M	But if you wait too long, you risk the enemy\ntaking it first, huh? Tough choice, buddy!
homeSushibar_10_in_01_M	Heyyy! Look who's here!
homeSushibar_10_in_02_M	I was just thinking how it's feeling cramped\nin here lately. It's time to expand again!
homeSushibar_10_in_03_M	Already?!
homeSushibar_10_in_03_F	Already?!
homeSushibar_10_in_04_M	Yeah, already! Time is money! There's just\none problem.
homeSushibar_10_in_05_M	Let me guess... You need more of those\n{c[91ff1e]}Mysterious Stones{c[000000]}?
homeSushibar_10_in_05_F	Let me guess... You need more of those\n{c[91ff1e]}Mysterious Stones{c[000000]}?
homeSushibar_10_in_06_M	Whooooaaaa! Are you psychic or something?\nI was just about to say that!
homeSushibar_10_in_07_M	I just put two and two together.
homeSushibar_10_in_07_F	I just put two and two together.
homeSushibar_10_in_08_M	Anyway, yeah. And this time, I need\n{c[ffcc2f]}seven {c[000000]}{c[91ff1e]}Mysterious Stones{c[000000]}!
homeSushibar_10_in_09_M	{c[ffcc2f]}Seven{c[000000]} of them?! That's a lot to ask...
homeSushibar_10_in_10_M	But sure, I'm up for it!
homeSushibar_10_in_10_F	But sure, I'm up for it!
homeSushibar_10_in_11_M	Thanks a million! Lemme know when\nyou've got something!
homeSushibar_11_in_01_M	Musashi! Always a welcome sight!
homeSushibar_11_cmn_01_M	Plenty of good info for ya today.
homeSushibar_11_a_01_M	I should let the customer speak for herself!
homeSushibar_11_a_02_M	I'm pleased as punch that Ausprey has gone\nback to liking normal sushi!
homeSushibar_11_a_03_M	If you tell him this, I'll deny it, but...\nI hate wasabi! I can't stomach it at all!
homeSushibar_11_a_04_M	I always secretly scraped mine off and gave\nit to the girl next to me.
homeSushibar_11_b_01_M	There's another customer who wanted to\ntalk to you too...
homeSushibar_11_b_02_M	Woe is me... Pwincess Purrsilla went back\nto an ordinary life, and I've left the squad.
homeSushibar_11_b_03_M	What I had yearned for all this time is no\nlonger there to be had!
homeSushibar_11_b_04_M	Who? Who will take up the mantle of being\nmy harsh, unforgiving pwincess?!
homeSushibar_11_c_01_M	Hey, so, y'know those {c[91ff1e]}Mysterious Stones{c[000000]}?\nTurns out there's lots in {c[ffcc2f]}hidden stages{c[000000]}.
homeSushibar_11_c_02_M	Course, that does mean you need to collect\nstars to open the hidden stages up...
homeSushibar_11_c_03_M	Oh well! No hurry, right?
homeSushibar_11_d_01_M	There's a customer who wants to talk to you!
homeSushibar_11_d_02_M	I know what ol' Ausprey looks like, but he's\na veteran who fought in the Sushi Struggles.
homeSushibar_11_d_04_M	Maybe that's why he's so stoic. Not just in\nbattle but when it comes to playtime, too.
homeSushibar_11_d_05_M	Once we were playing hide and seek, and he\nyelled, "Y'think this is some kinda game?!"
homeSushibar_11_e_01_M	I've got a customer here with something to\nsay to you!
homeSushibar_11_e_02_M	Ah, Musashi. You have my thanks for what\nyou did for Pwincess Purrsilla.
homeSushibar_11_e_03_M	Though you did ask if she was someone's\naunt, which is worth a demerit in my book.
homeSushibar_11_e_04_M	The very idea! Any TRUE fan would know\nthat Pwincess has no brothers or sisters!
homeSushibar_11_f_01_M	When you're stuck on the same stage and\nkeep losing over and over...
homeSushibar_11_f_02_M	That's when it's time to swallow your pride\nand use a {c[91ff1e]}Renewal Bean{c[000000]}!
homeSushibar_11_f_03_M	I hear you can find 'em in hidden stages\nor win them in Puzzle Matches.
homeSushibar_11_btn_01_M	Look! I got seven {c[91ff1e]}Mysterious Stones{c[000000]}!
homeSushibar_11_btn_01_F	Look! I got seven {c[91ff1e]}Mysterious Stones{c[000000]}!
homeSushibar_11_stone_01_M	Hey, whaddaya know? Good work!
homeSushibar_11_stone_02_M	Told you I'd get 'em!
homeSushibar_11_stone_02_F	Told you I'd get 'em!
homeSushibar_11_stone_03_M	You're as good as your word! And so am I,\nwhich means it's time to start expanding!
homeSushibar_11_stone_05_M	Nice, isn't it? No doubt we'll be busier\nthan ever here!
homeSushibar_11_stone_06_M	Probably get better rumors floating around\ntoo, so come back later if you wanna hear!
homeSushibar_12_in_01_M	Yo, Musashi! Thanks for coming!
homeSushibar_12_cmn_01_M	Plenty of good info for ya today.
homeSushibar_12_a_01_M	Turns out the engineer who built the ultimate \nlane-drive gear built another powerful gear.
homeSushibar_12_a_02_M	It's not ULTIMATE, but it's supposed to be a\nstep up from what you can get at the shrine.
homeSushibar_12_a_03_M	Makes me wonder what kinda speed the\nultimate gear can put out...
homeSushibar_12_b_01_M	Hmmm... Oh, right!
homeSushibar_12_b_02_M	Kyatten told me to tell him if you\ncame around! Here y'go!
homeSushibar_12_b_03_M	Hoh hoh hoh! Greetings, Musashi.\nI owe my awakening to you as well.
homeSushibar_12_b_04_M	I enjoy it here, creating sushi for the\npeople who come to eat.
homeSushibar_12_b_05_M	After all, creating sushi from thin air is\nwhat I do best! Hoh hoh hoh!
homeSushibar_12_c_01_M	If you eat a lot of one kind of sushi in battle,\nyou'll get that sushi's raw power!
homeSushibar_12_c_02_M	It's a good reason to switch out your Sprite\nOrder sometimes and try new sushi.
homeSushibar_12_c_03_M	If your sprites level too much to feed you\nany more low-quality sushi, though...
homeSushibar_12_c_04_M	You can eat a little bit of low-quality sushi at\na time by trying your hand at the Puzzle Hut!
homeSushibar_12_d_01_M	There's a customer who was asking about\nyou. Wanna talk to him?
homeSushibar_12_d_02_M	I'll admit...I miss the days when Pwincess\nforbade us from eating salmon and tuna.
homeSushibar_12_d_03_M	I don't like them at all, you see, and her\norders made for a convenient excuse.
homeSushibar_12_d_04_M	But maybe the time has come to reconsider?\nA round of tuna, please! It builds character!
homeSushibar_12_e_01_M	A lady from the Empire wanted to talk\nto you. About what? I dunnoâ€”ask her!
homeSushibar_12_e_02_M	Y'know, we had good times in Ausprey's\nsquad, but the wasabi wasn't so good.
homeSushibar_12_e_03_M	The worst was how my squad mate always\nused to ask me to eat her wasabi for her...
homeSushibar_12_e_04_M	I did it 'cause we were friends, but the truth\nis that I hated the stuff just as much.
homeSushibar_12_f_01_M	Feel like chatting with a customer?
homeSushibar_12_f_02_M	Oh... So you're General Tiburon's child.\nThat explains a lot.
homeSushibar_12_f_03_M	But you're no match for your father yet. His\nconvictions make him strong in battle.
homeSushibar_12_f_04_M	You won't sway a man like him with logic.\nMake an appeal to sushi instead.
homeSushibar_13_in_01_M	I just heard something REALLY interesting!
homeSushibar_13_a_01_M	This is the straight truth from a source\nI trust completely.
homeSushibar_13_a_02_M	Yeah, that ultimate lane-drive gear that\ngot stolen? I know where it is!
homeSushibar_13_a_03_M	The thieves took it to an underground military\nresearch facility in the Eastern Empire!
homeSushibar_13_a_04_M	And that ain't all! They're up to some\nunbelievable experiments there!
homeSushibar_13_a_05_M	Unbelievable, huh? I feel like at this point\nI would believe anything...
homeSushibar_13_a_05_F	Unbelievable, huh? I feel like at this point\nI would believe anything...
homeSushibar_13_a_06_M	Anyway, sounds like I'd better check it out!
homeSushibar_13_a_06_F	Anyway, sounds like I'd better check it out!
homeSushibar_13_a_07_M	Cool! In that case, I'll mark the eastern part\nof the Empire on your map.
homeSushibar_13_a_08_M	Thanks, Archie!
homeSushibar_13_a_08_F	Thanks, Archie!
homeSushibar_13_a_09_M	Sure thing! Take care of yourself!
homeSushibar_14_in_01_M	Yo, Musashi! I was hoping you'd come!
homeSushibar_14_a_01_M	Wanna talk to the customers for a minute?
homeSushibar_14_a_02_M	Hey, kid! You ready to hear the secret of\nhow we got so built?!
homeSushibar_14_a_03_M	It's sushi! White sushi has all the protein\nyou need to firm up those abs!
homeSushibar_14_a_04_M	With a steady diet of white sushi and a daily\ntraining plan, you too can get JACKED!
homeSushibar_14_b_01_M	One of the customers wanted to say\nsomething to you...
homeSushibar_14_b_02_M	Yo! Kodiak's been taking his time eating\nsushi all of the sudden. Weird, huh?
homeSushibar_14_b_03_M	He seems happy eating sushi without having\nto think about how to use it in a fight.
homeSushibar_14_b_04_M	Of course, he still works out! And you KNOW\nhe still practices proper skin care too!
homeSushibar_15_in_01_M	Musashi! I hoped you'd show up!
homeSushibar_15_a_01_M	Plenty of good info for ya today.
homeSushibar_15_a_02_M	You hear about the mysterious explosion on\nthat tiny island to the south of the Empire?
homeSushibar_15_a_03_M	That's the place they say the ultimate lane-\ndrive gear ended up...
homeSushibar_15_a_04_M	Wow. That sounds...bad.
homeSushibar_15_a_04_F	Wow. That sounds...bad.
homeSushibar_15_a_05_M	Sure does! Let me show you where the\nisland is on your map.
homeSushibar_15_a_06_M	Thanks. I'll look into that as soon as I can!
homeSushibar_15_a_06_F	Thanks. I'll look into that as soon as I can!
homeSushibar_15_a_07_M	Take care, Musashi!
homeSushibar_16_in_01_M	You sure picked an interesting time to\ncome around, heheh!
homeSushibar_16_a_01_M	There's someone here who wants to\nmeet you!
homeSushibar_16_a_02_M	Heheh... It's been some time, eh, Musashi?
homeSushibar_16_a_03_M	Whoa, hey, Kodiak! How's everything\ngoing? Good, I hope?
homeSushibar_16_a_03_F	Whoa, hey, Kodiak! How's everything\ngoing? Good, I hope?
homeSushibar_16_a_04_M	Quite so! Enjoying the taste of sushi is a\nnovel change. It's good for my muscles, too!
homeSushibar_16_a_05_M	I'm traveling the world now, sampling all the\nvarieties of sushi it has to offer.
homeSushibar_16_a_06_M	Nice! I'm glad things are turning out well!
homeSushibar_16_a_06_F	Nice! I'm glad things are turning out well!
homeSushibar_16_a_07_M	Why, I can't even remember the last time\nI used Buff Buffet.
homeSushibar_16_a_08_M	Ahahah! So I came to give you my old sushi\nsprite. Look grateful, hmm?
homeSushibar_16_a_09_M	{s[150]}Whaaaa?!{s[100]}
homeSushibar_16_a_09_F	{s[150]}Whaaaa?!{s[100]}
homeSushibar_16_a_10_M	Oh, yes! It's yours for the taking. Consider\nit my way of apologizing.
homeSushibar_16_a_12_M	Hmph. Name's Wani-o. You gonna eat\nmy pledge sushi or what?
homeSushibar_16_a_13_M	You've befriended the sushi sprite {c[91ff1e]}Wani-o{c[000000]}!\nIts skill is {c[91ff1e]}Buff Buffet{c[000000]}!
homeSushibar_16_a_14_M	Ha! And there you have it. Take good\ncare of Wani-o!
homeSushibar_16_a_15_M	Buff Buffet is better than Sushi Bonanza in\nthat you can link away as long as it lasts.
homeSushibar_16_a_16_M	Although... You'll find that any plates you\nstack are of the lowest quality. Ah well.
homeSushibar_16_a_17_M	May we meet again someday!
homeSushibar_17_in_01_M	Yo, Musashi! Pretty lively crowd today!
homeSushibar_17_g_01_M	I should let one of the customers talk...
homeSushibar_17_g_02_M	Ha-hah! I'll give the boys of Kodiak's\nsquad one thing: they're nice and tough!
homeSushibar_17_g_03_M	And I'm sure that does it for some people.\nBut it's not really my thing.
homeSushibar_17_g_04_M	I like the soft, marshmallowy ones! You\ndon't know anybody like that, do you?
homeSushibar_17_k_01_M	I should let one of the customers talk...
homeSushibar_17_k_02_M	Why do you suppose everyone in Kodiak's\ntroop is so muscular?
homeSushibar_17_k_03_M	Does the general recruit for that trait?\nOr is it a natural by-product of joining up?
homeSushibar_17_k_04_M	It's all very mysterious to me, and I'm sure\nI want nothing to do with it.
homeSushibar_17_n_01_M	I should let one of the customers talk...
homeSushibar_17_n_02_M	All the guys in Purrsilla's squad\nare total babes!
homeSushibar_17_n_03_M	Their stiff movements, their sparkly eyes...\nIt's all too much! I can't take it!
homeSushibar_17_n_04_M	Huh... Is this what they mean when they\nsay opposites attract?
homeSushibar_17_o_01_M	I should let one of the customers talk...
homeSushibar_17_o_02_M	I've observed that the members of Ausprey's\nsquad are never far from their general.
homeSushibar_17_o_03_M	It must take a toll on one to be so\ncompletely at another's beck and call.
homeSushibar_17_o_04_M	Hm? Why no, it's no trouble at all to be at\nour Pwincess's side day in, day out, all year.
homeSushibar_17_r_01_M	I should let one of the customers talk...
homeSushibar_17_r_02_M	There's a lotta reasons to eat sushi!\nNumber one: the protein in it builds muscle!
homeSushibar_17_r_03_M	Number two: you need to eat as much as\nyou can to wallop your enemies!
homeSushibar_17_r_04_M	Number three: it just tastes good!\nYou taught us that's the best reason of all!
homeSushibar_17_s_01_M	I should let one of the customers talk...
homeSushibar_17_s_02_M	Yo! You're probably wondering why we wear\nway less than other squads.
homeSushibar_17_s_03_M	You weren't?! Well, I'll tell you anyway!
homeSushibar_17_s_04_M	It's because our muscles are so rock hard\nthat they're all the armor we need! BAM!
homeSushibar_17_t_01_M	I should let one of the customers talk...
homeSushibar_17_t_02_M	If you ask me, Purrsilla's troops need to\nput on a few pounds!
homeSushibar_17_t_03_M	I don't get how they can be so pasty and\nstill win fights.
homeSushibar_17_t_04_M	It's almost like...muscles and sushi striking...\nhave nothing to do with each other...
homeSushibar_17_u_01_M	I should let one of the customers talk...
homeSushibar_17_u_02_M	Ever come across that one striker nobody\nseems to know anything about?
homeSushibar_17_u_03_M	Yeah, you know the one. I've just learned\nsomething very interesting about him.
homeSushibar_17_u_04_M	That man called Rio... Those glasses he\nwears? The lenses are fake!
homeSushibar_cap4_00_M	Musashi! Musashi!
homeSushibar_cap4_01_M	What's up, Archie? Did you finish\nanother building?
homeSushibar_cap4_01_F	What's up, Archie? Did you finish\nanother building?
homeSushibar_cap4_02_M	Yeah! It's a place for the Republic kids\nwithout any family, here in the Shrine Grove!
homeSushibar_cap4_03_M	Whoa... That's really cool of you!
homeSushibar_cap4_03_F	Whoa... That's really cool of you!
homeSushibar_cap4_04_M	Heheh. Stop by later! I can't wait to\nsee whatcha think!
homeSushibar_cap4_05_X4_M	Almost there...
homeSushibar_cap4_05_X6_M	I think that does it!
homeSushibar_cap5_00_M	Musashi! Musashi!
homeSushibar_cap5_01_M	How's it going, Archie? Let me guessâ€”\nyou finished another building!
homeSushibar_cap5_01_F	How's it going, Archie? Let me guessâ€”\nyou finished another building!
homeSushibar_cap5_02_M	Haha, you guessed it! This one's a fun\nplace for you to train!
homeSushibar_cap5_03_M	That's just what I needed!\nHow did you know?!
homeSushibar_cap5_03_F	That's just what I needed!\nHow did you know?!
homeSushibar_cap5_04_M	Call it a hunch! Depending on how you do,\nyou could win new stuff, so don't be shy!
homeSushibar_cap5_05_M	There we go!
\event\homeTower.msbt
homeTower_cmn_out_01_M	Sure, come give it a shot whenever!
homeTower_01_01_M	Yo, Musashi! Glad you're here!
homeTower_01_02_M	I got a new kinda challenge for you:\na {c[91ff1e]}Puzzle Match{c[000000]} with some neat new rules!

tutorial03_01_M	Since this is your first fight as a sushi\nstriker, I'll teach you the ins and outs.
tutorial03_02_M	Every sushi sprite has its own power\nto grant. We call these "skills."
tutorial03_03_M	When you eat sushi, we draw on that to\ngain power, which fills this gauge.
tutorial03_04_M	When the gauge is full, the button flashes.\nTouch the button then to use the skill!
tutorial03_05_M	My own skill is {c[91ff1e]}Sushi Bonanza{c[000000]}, which turns\nall of your plates to the same color.
tutorial03_06_M	You can link all the sushi in your lanes\nthat way! Use it wisely!

tutorial04_01_F	Hey, what's a {c[5fd871]}lane-drive gear{c[000000]}?!
tutorial04_02_M	Hm. With a {c[5fd871]}lane-drive gear{c[000000]}, you can\n{c[ffcc2f]}control {c[000000]}the {c[ffcc2f]}speed {c[000000]}of your {c[ffcc2f]}lanes{c[000000]}!
tutorial04_03_M	Really? How?!
tutorial04_03_F	Really? How?!
tutorial04_04_M	While {c[ffcc2f]}touching {c[000000]}the lane, {c[ffcc2f]}keep your stylus\nin place{c[000000]} and the lane will accelerate!
tutorial04_05_M	But...if I don't move the stylus, how am\nI supposed to link plates together?
tutorial04_05_F	But...if I don't move the stylus, how am\nI supposed to link plates together?
tutorial04_06_M	The idea is to speed up until the sushi you\nwant draws near, then to link again.
tutorial04_07_M	Do you see? {c[ffcc2f]}Hold the stylus{c[000000]}, accelerate,\nlink plates, {c[ffcc2f]}hold {c[000000]}again... And so on.
tutorial04_08_M	That's pretty cool!
tutorial04_08_F	That's pretty cool!
tutorial04_09_M	{c[ffcc2f]}Hold down{c[000000]} on the lane to make it speed up,\nthen {c[ffcc2f]}zig-zag{c[000000]} to link plates!
Telop_00_M	This is the fundamental technique of\nthe game. Try for {c[ffcc2f]}10 plates{c[000000]}â€”then {c[ffcc2f]}20{c[000000]}!
Telop_00_F	This is the fundamental technique of\nthe game. Try for {c[ffcc2f]}10 plates{c[000000]}â€”then {c[ffcc2f]}20{c[000000]}!

tutorial05_01_M	Pssst. What's this "capsule" stuff he's\ntalking about?
tutorial05_01_F	Pssst. What's this "capsule" stuff he's\ntalking about?
tutorial05_02_M	I'll explain. Capsules contain items,\nwhich can be very helpful to a striker.
tutorial05_03_M	However, they are generally locked.
tutorial05_04_M	Locked?! Then how do we get to the\njuicy items inside?
tutorial05_04_F	Locked?! Then how do we get to the\njuicy items inside?
tutorial05_05_M	Simple. Take the {c[91ff1e]}capsule {c[000000]}after linking {c[ffcc2f]}at\nleast as many plates as shown on the lock{c[000000]}.
tutorial05_07_M	Wow! The {c[91ff1e]}jubilee gauge{c[000000]} got a huge boost!
tutorial05_07_F	Wow! The {c[91ff1e]}jubilee gauge{c[000000]} got a huge boost!
tutorial05_08_M	Yes, a result of the item I unlocked.\nOther items do other things.
tutorial05_09_M	Take capsules before the enemy can to\ngive yourself an advantage in battle!
tutorial05_10_M	Ah, you noticed that? That {c[5fd871]}sound {c[000000]}plays\nwhen a capsule appears. Listen for it!

CharaSerif_00_M	Hey... Aren't you Musashi?
CharaSerif_01_M	Sir! This could be just the break we need!

CharaSerif_03_M	What's going on with you two?
CharaSerif_03_F	What's going on with you two?
CharaSerif_04_M	Though it galls me to admit it, our sushi\nsprite is missing. We need you to find it.
CharaSerif_05_M	Huh?! Are you for real?!
CharaSerif_05_F	Huh?! Are you for real?!
CharaSerif_06_M	Our best lead right now is that the sprite\nenjoys watching sushi battles.
CharaSerif_07_M	Which is where you come in. Fight my\nsquad! And make it look good!
CharaSerif_08_M	Then when it shows up to watch, I'll take\nit back, easy as you please.
CharaSerif_09_M	Good grief... I guess we were gonna\nfight anyway, so I might as well.
CharaSerif_09_F	Good grief... I guess we were gonna\nfight anyway, so I might as well.

CharaSerif_00_F	Please tell me you've found the sushi\nsprite by now.
CharaSerif_01_M	With your help, yes, we did. Our plan to\ndefeat you has reached its final phase!
CharaSerif_02_M	Say what?! Then this was a trick from\nthe start?!
CharaSerif_02_F	Say what?! Then this was a trick from\nthe start?!
CharaSerif_03_M	I was quite clear when I asked for your help\nthat I would get the sprite. Not you.
CharaSerif_04_M	Meet {c[91ff1e]}Popokan{c[000000]}, wielder of {c[91ff1e]}Budget Striker{c[000000]}!

CharaSerif_03_F	So are you the one who gave us that tip\nabout the ultimate lane-drive gear?
CharaSerif_04_M	Yes. Not only am I the priestess at this\nshrine, I'm also a lane-drive gear engineer.
CharaSerif_05_M	Do you have it? The rock I need to craft\nthe ultimate gear?
CharaSerif_06_M	You mean...this li'l guy?

CharaSerif_08_F	Great! So now you can use this to make me\nthe ultimate lane-drive gear?
CharaSerif_09_M	I believe so. I'll get started right away.\nWait here, please. I won't be long.

CharaSerif_01_M	Musashi?! Like I didn't have enough\nproblems already!
CharaSerif_02_M	Too bad for you! Wherever there's a sushi\nsprite up for grabs, there I am too!
CharaSerif_02_F	Too bad for you! Wherever there's a sushi\nsprite up for grabs, there I am too!

CharaSerif_00_M	Woooo! Finally found the sushi sprite shrine!

CharaSerif_01_M	You certainly did. The Empire thanks you\nfor your service.
CharaSerif_02_M	Now get out of our way!
CharaSerif_03_M	Yeah, right. If anyone's going to pledge\nwith this sushi sprite, it'll be me!
CharaSerif_03_F	Yeah, right. If anyone's going to pledge\nwith this sushi sprite, it'll be me!

CharaSerif_04_M	Good point! I'm supposed to be looking for\na sushi sprite, but I'm having no luck.
CharaSerif_05_M	Hyah! So I figured, might as well get some\nreps in. There's never a bad time to flex!
CharaSerif_06_M	That was a couple months ago. Truth is\nI spend more time training than searching.
CharaSerif_07_M	Yeah... You don't say.
CharaSerif_07_F	Yeah... You don't say.
CharaSerif_08_M	I just wish one of my buddies hadn't gone\nmissing! Who's gonna spot me now?!

CharaSerif_02_F	This guy seems weirdly chill for one of\nKodiak's squad...
CharaSerif_03_M	Y'see, I found the shrine in this forest.\nThe sushi sprite there pledged with me.
CharaSerif_04_M	After that, there was nothing left to do but\nhole up here and train.
CharaSerif_05_M	Are you that missing soldier I've\nheard about?
CharaSerif_05_F	Are you that missing soldier I've\nheard about?
CharaSerif_06_M	Yeah, I guess. There's nothing more to learn\nfrom those guys about sushi and muscles.
CharaSerif_07_M	You and me should fight. See what it's like\nto go toe-to-toe with a real tough guy.
CharaSerif_08_M	I'll introduce you to that sprite, {c[91ff1e]}Anubiva{c[000000]},\nand his skill {c[91ff1e]}HP Swap{c[000000]}.

CharaSerif_06_M	Should I ask why?
CharaSerif_06_F	Should I ask why?
CharaSerif_07_M	Because I found the sushi sprite {c[91ff1e]}Chamelva{c[000000]}, \nsource of the former Emperor's power.

CharaSerif_04_M	The artificial sushi gate didn't work out.\nSomething about the viscosity of the rice.
CharaSerif_05_M	Explain.
CharaSerif_06_M	They TRIED to open a gate to the sushi world\nwith energy from colliding light-speed sushi.
CharaSerif_07_M	But the rice was so sticky that it absorbed\nall the energy, so no sushi gate.
CharaSerif_08_M	Seriously?! Score one for rice!
CharaSerif_08_F	Seriously?! Score one for rice!
CharaSerif_09_M	*sigh*
CharaSerif_10_M	Not so fast. Instead of a portal to the sushi\nworld, they got a portal to a parallel world!
CharaSerif_11_M	A WHAT?!
CharaSerif_11_F	A WHAT?!
CharaSerif_12_M	It's kinda cool! There's lots of possibilities!\nI just flick this switch, and here one comes!

stageBeginM004_09_M	That was you?! Why would you do that?!
stageBeginM004_09_F	That was you?! Why would you do that?!
stageBeginM004_10_M	Because I'm sick of living in this run-down\nRepublic without a bite of sushi to my name.

stageEndM004_08_M	Mweheh... All right, who's got my\npledge plate now?
stageEndM004_09_M	Oh, it's Penzo! It's been some time,\nold friend.
stageEndM004_10_M	If it isn't the great Jinrai! Rare to see you\ntake a sushi striker under your wing.
stageEndM004_13_M	Indeed. I think he has potential, and I want\nto see where it goes.
stageEndM004_13_F	Indeed. I think she has potential, and I want\nto see where it goes.

stageEndM004_16_M	Everyone has a name! Mine's Musashi!
stageEndM004_16_F	Everyone has a name! Mine's Musashi!

stageEndM004_19_M	New power is now open to you, Musashi.
stageEndM004_20_M	As sushi strikers ally with more sprites,\nthey master more useful skills.
stageEndM004_21_M	But be warned, Musashi.
stageEndM004_22_M	Kojiro's report will spread, and you will find\nmany Imperial soldiers wanting to control me.

stageEndM004_12_M	You also need a {c[91ff1e]}Skill Charm{c[000000]} to enhance\na sushi sprite's {c[ffae00]}skill level{c[000000]}.

stageEndM009_02_M	But in return, can I rely on you to work\nwith us? Our interests are aligned, after all.
stageEndM009_03_M	The Empire is beginning to execute their\nSushi Stranglehold Scheme.
stageEndM009_04_M	You and your sushi sprite would be\ninvaluable allies in putting a stop to it.
stageEndM009_05_M	They already have almost all the sushi,\nand they want even more?!
stageEndM009_05_F	They already have almost all the sushi,\nand they want even more?!
stageEndM009_05B_M	I can't stand them!
stageEndM009_05B_F	I can't stand them!
stageEndM009_06_M	Neither can we.
stageEndM009_07_M	Which is why we aim to liberate all of the\nsushi gates in the land.
stageEndM009_08_M	Our end goal is a world where anyone who\nwants sushi can have it.
stageEndM009_10_M	Then we're in!
stageEndM009_10_F	Then we're in!
stageEndM009_10B_M	That's a cause worth fighting for!

stageEndM009_11_F	Plus, going after the Empire means we're\nbound to find Franklin!
stageEndM009_12_M	In that case, welcome to the resistance.
stageEndM009_13_M	We're having a strategy meeting soon, and\nwe'd like your involvement.
stageEndM009_14_M	But first, consider a few sushi sprites and\nselect one to ally with.
stageEndM009_15_M	Whoa. You're giving me a sushi sprite?\nJust like that?
stageEndM009_15_F	Whoa. You're giving me a sushi sprite?\nJust like that?
stageEndM009_16_M	Oh, yes. We're asking a lot of you, so we\nmust make sure you're ready to bear it.

stageEndM009_18_M	Feel free to pick whichever sushi sprite\nyou like.

stageEndM009_21_M	Congratulations on earning your third\npledge. You're a proper sushi striker now.
stageEndM009_22_M	Sushi battles are meant to be fought with\nthree sprites. Their skills will take you far.

CharaSerif_20_M	Hrrrh... I've heard of this Jubay, but I had no\ninkling that you were related.
CharaSerif_21_M	Yeah...me either. So my dad was a legendary\nsushi striker, huh?
CharaSerif_21_F	Yeah...me either. So my dad was a legendary\nsushi striker, huh?
CharaSerif_22_M	Jinrai...you said you heard of him!\nWhat do you know? What was he like?
CharaSerif_22_F	Jinrai...you said you heard of him!\nWhat do you know? What was he like?
CharaSerif_23_M	Well... I'll tell you what I recall.
CharaSerif_24_M	I don't remember him much. I was real\nlittle...and he never said why he left...
CharaSerif_24_F	I don't remember him much. I was real\nlittle...and he never said why he left...
CharaSerif_25_M	Jubay was the Republic's ace striker in the\nSushi Struggles. "Legendary" is an apt term.
CharaSerif_26_M	He loved sushi with a fierce passion. He was\nknown as a man who'd give his life for sushi.
CharaSerif_27_M	His... His life?
CharaSerif_28_M	That's all I remember. After a certain point,\nI didn't hear much about him anymore.
CharaSerif_29_M	{s[150]}Then the war...he must've...!{s[100]}

CharaSerif_31_M	If all I've heard of the man is true, I don't\ndoubt he's alive somewhere in this world.
CharaSerif_32_M	Those who appreciate sushi find that sushi\nrepays the favor.
\event\stageEndM050.msbt
CharaSerif_00_M	Oh well... You got the better of me.\nWell done, little Musashi.
CharaSerif_01_M	Maybe you're the one who can make\nGeneral Ausprey see reason.
CharaSerif_03_M	When he was younger, General Ausprey\nloved sushi with all his heart.
CharaSerif_04_M	But he grew...eccentric and now cares\nmore about seasoning than sushi.
CharaSerif_05_M	He gets crabby when people don't get it,\nmaking him push wasabi even harder.
CharaSerif_06_M	Hrrh. Ironic that a man would love sushi so\nmuch that he became blind to its potential.
CharaSerif_07_M	Do something, Musashi! Find a way to bring\nback the OLD old man!
CharaSerif_08_M	I'll see what I can do!
CharaSerif_08_F	I'll see what I can do!
CharaSerif_09_M	(This all feels strangely familiar...)
CharaSerif_10_M	Wonderful! Don't tell him I gave you this,\nbut maybe this pledge plate will help.

CharaSerif_02_M	Hah! NOW the tyke wants wasabi!\nYeah, yeah, rub it in.
CharaSerif_03_M	Come on, please? Just a little?
CharaSerif_03_F	Come on, please? Just a little?
CharaSerif_04_M	What's your game here? I already know\nyou can't stomach the stuff.
CharaSerif_05_M	Glurrrrk! I thought I was ready, but I\nREALLY, REALLY wasn't!
CharaSerif_05_F	Glurrrrk! I thought I was ready, but I\nREALLY, REALLY wasn't!
CharaSerif_06_M	I just thought... Maybe since I knew what\nto expect, it would be OK...
CharaSerif_06_F	I just thought... Maybe since I knew what\nto expect, it would be OK...
CharaSerif_07_M	But don't worry! Someday I'll get the\nhang of it!
CharaSerif_07_F	But don't worry! Someday I'll get the\nhang of it!
CharaSerif_08_M	When I'm older, I bet I'll love wasabi!\nI can't wait to grow up!
CharaSerif_08_F	When I'm older, I bet I'll love wasabi!\nI can't wait to grow up!
CharaSerif_09_M	Is this a trick? What's your angle?
CharaSerif_10_M	There is no one "true taste" of sushi.
CharaSerif_11_M	There are as many ways to enjoy sushi\nas there are people who eat it.
CharaSerif_12_M	You must respect those ways as you would\nrespect the people themselves.
CharaSerif_13_M	Hmmm... Maybe I came on a little strong.\nJust like wasabi, am I right?
CharaSerif_14_M	Here, Musashi. This is to show there's\nno hard feelings.
CharaSerif_15_M	You got {c[91ff1e]}Ausprey's Key{c[000000]}!
CharaSerif_16_M	I guess there's worse in life than being\nan old coot who loves wasabi.

CharaSerif_03_F	Then you know what happened to him,\nright? You gotta tell me!
CharaSerif_04_M	Well... Let's not get carried away. I don't\nhave him on speed dial or anything.
CharaSerif_05_M	Of course not.
CharaSerif_05_F	Of course not.
CharaSerif_06_M	But don't fall to pieces just yet! I do know\nwho WOULD know!
CharaSerif_07_M	Take another goose at the photo. I'm talking\nabout this guy! Right here!
CharaSerif_08_M	Huh. I completely missed that there was\na third person in the picture.
CharaSerif_08_F	Huh. I completely missed that there was\na third person in the picture.
CharaSerif_09_M	Probably because his finger's in the way.
CharaSerif_10_M	Whoopsie doozy!
CharaSerif_11_M	Masa?!
CharaSerif_12_M	Right, right, that's his name! Him and Jubay\nfought for the Republic together!

CharaSerif_19_M	Yeah. I don't think I can focus on battle\nuntil I get some answers.
CharaSerif_19_F	Yeah. I don't think I can focus on battle\nuntil I get some answers.
CharaSerif_20_M	I didn't expect you back so soon, Musashi.\nIs something on your mind?
CharaSerif_21_M	Hey, Masa... Do you know a guy\nnamed Jubay?
CharaSerif_21_F	Hey, Masa... Do you know a guy\nnamed Jubay?
CharaSerif_22_M	Hm! I haven't heard that name in some time.
CharaSerif_23_M	But yes, we served together in the Struggles.\nWe were very close.
CharaSerif_24_M	Then did you know he's my dad?!
CharaSerif_24_F	Then did you know he's my dad?!
CharaSerif_25_M	Haha... Of course. I knew it as soon as\nI saw your jacket.
CharaSerif_26_M	I had planned to tell you someday, and it\nseems that "someday" has come.
CharaSerif_27_M	Where would you like to start?
CharaSerif_28_M	What Musashi wants most is to see his\nfather. Do you know where Jubay is now?
CharaSerif_28_F	What Musashi wants most is to see her\nfather. Do you know where Jubay is now?
CharaSerif_29_M	C'mon, spill it!
CharaSerif_29_F	C'mon, spill it!
CharaSerif_30_M	I can't tell you. I would, but...he passed\nseveral years ago.
CharaSerif_31_M	No...
CharaSerif_32_M	The Sushi Struggles claimed him. Another\nthing we can thank the Empire for.
CharaSerif_33_M	We lost Jubay in our fight to bring sushi\nto the people.
CharaSerif_34_M	He's really...dead...?

CharaSerif_00_M	Elegantly done, Master Musashi.
CharaSerif_01_M	I had despaired at anyone saving Purrsilla,\nbut you may yet have a hope.
CharaSerif_02_M	I don't get it. Why are you being so nice\nto me all of the sudden?
CharaSerif_02_F	I don't get it. Why are you being so nice\nto me all of the sudden?
CharaSerif_03_M	There was a time when Purrsilla adored the\nred-fleshed sushi, such as salmon and tuna.
CharaSerif_04_M	And at that time, she had a lover who\nshared her tastes.
CharaSerif_05_M	One day, alas... Her lover left her.
CharaSerif_06_M	Wounded, Purrsilla found herself loathing the\nsight of her once-beloved salmon and tuna.
CharaSerif_07_M	And while she cannot remove it from the\nworld, she can forbid it in her domain.
CharaSerif_08_M	So that's how salmon and tuna came to be\nforbidden sushi... All over a bad breakup.
CharaSerif_11_M	Master Musashi, you must make Purrsilla\nsee reason! Mend her broken heart!
CharaSerif_12_M	All right. I'm on it!

CharaSerif_09_M	This flavor...it brings back so many\nmemories...
CharaSerif_10_M	It was only the end that was painful, really.\nWe had so many good times before that.

Enemy_StgWin_001	Now do you see what happens\nwhen you oppose the Empire?!
Enemy_StgWin_002	Hahaha! You're not even worth\nreporting to my superior!
Enemy_StgWin_003	Of course I won! Now do you\nadmit I'm better?!
Enemy_StgWin_004	I would call that victory sweet!\nWouldn't you?
Enemy_StgWin_005	Don't look so shocked that\nyou lost. Heheheh...
Enemy_StgWin_006	I told you! My Sushi Shield\ncan't be broken!
Enemy_StgWin_007	You're a sitting duck against\nmy Runaway Lanes!
Enemy_StgWin_008	And so you prove yourself\nunworthy to wield this sprite.
Enemy_StgWin_009	I knew you couldn't stand up\nto a sustained offense!
Enemy_StgWin_009_f	I knew you couldn't stand up\nto a sustained offense!
Enemy_StgWin_010	Looks like you haven't figured\nout the trick to capsules yet!
Enemy_StgWin_011	Are you surprised at my\nmastery of the special lane?
Enemy_StgWin_012	You'll rue the day you tussled\nwith Captain Chops!
Enemy_StgWin_013	Are you sorry yet you didn't\nsign up with the Empire?!
Enemy_StgWin_014	You're too scrawny to tango\nwith us!
Enemy_StgWin_015	The only thing that matters in a\nfight is who's got more muscle!
Enemy_StgWin_016	I dedicate this victory to my\nbarbells!
Enemy_StgWin_017	Bow down before the\nchiseled captain!
Enemy_StgWin_018	Whew! Now I probably won't\nget kicked out!
Enemy_StgWin_019	What's the matter? Was my\nSushi Shuffle too confusing?
Enemy_StgWin_020	I expected more.
Enemy_StgWin_021	Where Celia failed, I succeeded!\nMy future looks bright!
Enemy_StgWin_022	You might've gotten by Celia,\nbut you won't get by me!
Enemy_StgWin_023	Too bad, brat, but I can't let\nyou go any further.
Enemy_StgWin_023_f	Too bad, brat, but I can't let\nyou go any further.
Enemy_StgWin_024	Are you the Musashi from the\nreports? What's the big deal?
Enemy_StgWin_025	You're nothing much.\nJust another fool.
Enemy_StgWin_026	Haw haw haw! You don't have\nthe guts to take me on!
Enemy_StgWin_027	Another victory for my muscles!\nPerfectoralis major!
Enemy_StgWin_028	My victory, your loss.\nBuilding muscle like a boss.
Enemy_StgWin_029	These muscles of mine are why\nthey made me a captain!
Enemy_StgWin_030	That's it, then. The war is\nfinally over.
Enemy_StgWin_031	Gaaahahahaha! I'll buff you out!
Enemy_StgWin_032	*cough* Another win *sneeze*\nfor the *cough* Empire!
Enemy_StgWin_033	I win! Now I can go find some\neye drops...
Enemy_StgWin_034	A stopped-up nose won't stop\nme from eating sushi!
Enemy_StgWin_035	Even with a headache, I still\nmanaged to beat you!
Enemy_StgWin_036	Did I come at a bad time?
Enemy_StgWin_037	Yaaaaay! I win!
Enemy_StgWin_038	That was fun! Let's play again\nsometime!
Enemy_StgWin_039	Heehee... I never said I'd go\neasy on you!
Enemy_StgWin_040	I beat you! I can't wait to tell\nGeneral Ausprey!
Enemy_StgWin_041	What'd you think of Tubble-\nEdged Lanes? Great, huh?
Enemy_StgWin_042	If you can't eat wasabi, you\nwon't win. It's just a fact.
Enemy_StgWin_043	I don't know about you, but I\nlooooove wasabi! Heheheh!
Enemy_StgWin_044	Aaaahahaha! More wasabi!\nMORE!
Enemy_StgWin_045	Wasabi is the perfect topping\nto slather upon your defeat.
Enemy_StgWin_046	Yessss! Lookin' good, Rio!\nWhy, thanks, Rio!
Enemy_StgWin_047	I'll never let you through.\nToo bad for you!
Enemy_StgWin_048	Glad that's over! Now I can go\nplay hide-and-seek!
Enemy_StgWin_049	Yippee! Now what should I ask\nfor as my reward?
Enemy_StgWin_050	You're good, I'll grant you,\nbut no one's as good as me.
Enemy_StgWin_051	So there WAS a point to eating\nall that wasabi!
Enemy_StgWin_052	Not surprised you couldn't take\nmy Wasabi Blast. It's for adults!
Enemy_StgWin_053	Heh. I don't need to be an elite\nsoldier to beat you.
Enemy_StgWin_054	When I see my favorite sushi,\nI know I'm going to win!
Enemy_StgWin_055	Looks like the warning to be\ncareful with you was premature.
Enemy_StgWin_056	I don't go easy on anyone, not\neven kids. That's why I win.
Enemy_StgWin_057	Drumroll, please!\nThe winner is...meeeeeeee!
Enemy_StgWin_058	Tiburon's personal squad\nnever accepts defeat.
Enemy_StgWin_059	I'm an elite. I could beat you\nwith two lanes empty.
Enemy_StgWin_060	There's nothing shameful about\nlosing to me.
Enemy_StgWin_061	This is what you get when you\nface Tiburon's personal squad!
Enemy_StgWin_062	That's the power of the Imperial\nArmy's Magnetic Shot!
Enemy_StgWin_063	Guess you wore yourself out\nagainst the Magnetic Shot!
Enemy_StgWin_064	I see no reason for our captain\nto waste his time with you.
Enemy_StgWin_065	No strategy can beat hunger!\nWhoever keeps eating wins!
Enemy_StgWin_066	There'll be promotions all\naround now that we beat you!
Enemy_StgWin_067	I'll keep defending General\nTiburon as long as it takes!
Enemy_StgWin_068	Our squad's having a sushi\nparty to celebrate your defeat!
Enemy_StgWin_069	H-huh? Even with my busted\nhip, I somehow won?
Enemy_StgWin_070	Looks like my love for sushi\nwas stronger than yours!
Enemy_StgWin_071	I told you I wouldn't let you\nadvance! Weren't you listening?
Enemy_StgWin_072	Musashi, eh? You put up\na decent fight.
Enemy_StgWin_073	I told you the SLF's methods\nare supreme!
Enemy_StgWin_074	Your rampage ends here!
Enemy_StgWin_075	You're the SLF's big gun, huh?\nI've seen better.
Enemy_StgWin_076	You're not worth the time it\nwould take to gloat.
Enemy_StgWin_077	Victory is always delicious!
Enemy_StgWin_078	Having trouble there, sport?
Enemy_StgWin_079	You mustn't pass. Pwincess's\norders are absolute.
Enemy_StgWin_080	I obey our Pwincess in all\nthings, including stopping you.
Enemy_StgWin_081	Pwincess's orders are supreme.\nThis is as far as you go.
Enemy_StgWin_082	If Pwincess had allowed it, you\ncould go on. But she didn't.
Enemy_StgWin_083	I did it... I DID IT! I'm not a\ntotal failure after all!
Enemy_StgWin_084	See that? You don't need to\neat tuna or salmon to win!
Enemy_StgWin_085	This proves the forbidden sushi\nis forbidden for a reason!
Enemy_StgWin_086	Eat all the tuna and salmon you\nwant, but it won't help!
Enemy_StgWin_087	If I'm this good without the\nforbidden sushi, what if... No!
Enemy_StgWin_088	Well, lookie there! I won!
Enemy_StgWin_089	Our Pwincess ordered us to\ndefeat you. Nothing personal.
Enemy_StgWin_090	You fight well, Master Musashi,\nbut that's as far as you go.
Enemy_StgWin_091	My task for today was to stop\nyou, and now I have done so.
Enemy_StgWin_092	You came close but not quite\nclose enough.
Enemy_StgWin_093	Yeeeaaaah! Now I can get\npromoted out of this dump!
Enemy_StgWin_094	Hah! Know your place before\ndefying me, child!
Enemy_StgWin_095	I beat you! Didn't make me\nany warmer, though...
Enemy_StgWin_096	I won... But now I have to go\nback to guard duty in the cold.
Enemy_StgWin_097	I stopped you cold! Get it?\nD-d-do you g-g-g-et it?
Enemy_StgWin_098	The freezing air wasn't enough\nto slow me down!
Enemy_StgWin_099	Have you learned NOW what\nhappens when you oppose us?!
Enemy_StgWin_100	You're still too scrawny!\nGo and bulk up!
Enemy_StgWin_101	The only thing that matters in\nthe cold is who's got muscles!
Enemy_StgWin_102	Wait 'til I tell my barbells that\nI beat up Musashi!
Enemy_StgWin_103	You lose, so it's time to drop\nand give me twenty!
Enemy_StgWin_104	All that grudge-holding finally\npaid off!
Enemy_StgWin_105	Wow... The wasabi training\nactually worked!
Enemy_StgWin_106	I won! Y'see this? It's the flex\nof victory!
Enemy_StgWin_107	My perfectoralis major is in\nperfect condition!
Enemy_StgWin_108	Musashi lies here beaten,\nFrom the sushi I have eaten.
Enemy_StgWin_109	Us guys in Kodiak's crew carry\nthe Empire on our backs!
Enemy_StgWin_110	I'm the warden here, and I'll\nput down any breakout!
Enemy_StgWin_111	What's the matter, Musashi?\nNothing to say?
Enemy_StgWin_112	Of course you lost. I'm the\nstrongest in my squad!
Enemy_StgWin_113	You put up a good struggle, but\nI'm my squad's toughest fighter.
Enemy_StgWin_114	You were never really going to\nbeat the strongest of our squad.
Enemy_StgWin_115	The strongest of our squad?\nMe, obviously! I'm the captain!
Enemy_StgWin_116	You a little bushed, Musashi?\nYou seem off your game.
Enemy_StgWin_117	Looks like Sleeper can take\nthe day off today!
Enemy_StgWin_118	Hah! I'll have to tell Sawfish he\ndidn't miss much. 
Enemy_StgWin_119	Who needs the captain when I\ncan beat you all by myself?
Enemy_StgWin_120	My men couldn't do it, but then,\nthat's what I'm here for.
Enemy_StgWin_121	Magnetic Shot fire has\nneutralized the target!
Enemy_StgWin_122	I don't have Kodiak's squad's\nmuscle, but I don't need it!
Enemy_StgWin_123	Imagine how easy this would've\nbeen if I had used wasabi!
Enemy_StgWin_124	Purrsilla's squad has some\ninteresting tactics, but I did OK.
Enemy_StgWin_125	I'm not an elite in Tiburon's\nsquad, but don't count me out!
Enemy_StgWin_126	Leave it to me to see where\nyou're weak!
Enemy_StgWin_127	The belief in sushi we share\nwith General Tiburon is real!
Enemy_StgWin_128	You couldn't even beat me?\nDon't bother chasing Tiburon.
Enemy_StgWin_129	It's a shame you had to go up\nagainst the best of the best.
Enemy_StgWin_130	If I'm the last line of defense,\nso be it! I've done my job!
Enemy_StgWin_131	Is your faith in sushi so flimsy?\nYou disappoint me, Musashi.
Enemy_StgWin_132	Glory to the Emperor!\nAnd shame to the interloper...
Enemy_StgWin_133	Pathetic... Is this the best the\nSLF can muster?
Enemy_StgWin_134	No one passes these halls.\nNot on my watch.
Enemy_StgWin_135	My victory is Emperor\nOctavius's victory!
Enemy_StgWin_136	Wow! You've got my old pal\nwith you! What's with that?!
Enemy_StgWin_137	You eat with the sloppiness and\ncarelessness of a child...
Enemy_StgWin_138	Struggle all you like, but your\npower cannot compare to mine.
Enemy_StgWin_139	The Sushi Stranglehold Scheme\nwill prevail...
Enemy_StgWin_140	You are too weak to be allowed\nin our Emperor's presence!
Enemy_StgWin_141	All sushi belongs to the Empire!
Enemy_StgWin_142	We could not stop Jubay, but\nyou will go no further.
Enemy_StgWin_143	Tremble before the supreme\nfuture envisioned by the Empire!
Enemy_StgWin_144	This foolishness will stop! You\nwill never reach our Emperor!
Enemy_StgWin_145	I won't be satisfied with less\nthan all of your sushi...
Enemy_StgWin_146	Why do you smile when you\neat? Don't you see it's futile?
Enemy_StgWin_197	All right, now hand over\nthe rock!
Enemy_StgWin_198	I claim that weird rock for\nthe Empire! Heheheh!
Enemy_StgWin_199	You're not getting to that\nshrine! Not if I can help it!
Enemy_StgWin_200	You're well-informed, but that\ngets you nowhere with me.
Enemy_StgWin_201	They don't say I have a killer\nbod for nothing!
Enemy_StgWin_202	Beating you was a nice break,\nbut I gotta get back to the gym!
Enemy_StgWin_203	You thought you'd win? Hah!\nI'm the best one in my squad!
Enemy_StgWin_204	I'm the toughest of my squad,\nso you were bound to lose.
Enemy_StgWin_205	You didn't have a hope against\nour squad's strongest man!
Enemy_StgWin_206	Praise for my men didn't work,\nbut I got the gear in the end.
Enemy_StgWin_209	Hmph! This is no place for\nthe likes of you!
Enemy_StgWin_210	Another job well done!
Enemy_StgWin_211	Don't even think about breaking\ninto that military lab!
Enemy_StgWin_212	I can't allow you to interfere\nwith the Empire's experiments!
Enemy_StgWin_213	Wow, I won! And here I thought\nI was the weakest of our squad.
Enemy_StgWin_214	The captain can't call me the\nsquad's worst member anymore!
Enemy_StgWin_215	Today, I am no longer the\nlousiest soldier in our squad.
Enemy_StgWin_216	My worthless men all lost,\nso I'm leading by example!
Enemy_StgWin_217	This Magnetic Shot will be the\nlast thing you ever see!
Enemy_StgWin_218	That's for destroying our\nexpensive lab equipment!
Enemy_StgWin_219	Now lie there and watch as the\nEmpire's plan unfolds!
Enemy_StgWin_221	Phew. I almost slipped up and\nmentioned the rare sushi sprite.
Enemy_StgWin_222	You can go home! There's\nno rare sushi sprites here!
Enemy_StgWin_223	Now that I stopped you, maybe\nthe captain won't chew me out!
Enemy_StgWin_224	With Sun-o's power in my\nhands, I'm unstoppable!
Enemy_StgWin_225	Bet you didn't think I could\nbe that strong!
Enemy_StgWin_226	Whew! That was a good fight.\nNow it's time for a swim!
Enemy_StgWin_227	The boss said not to let anyone\npast, and that means you!
Enemy_StgWin_228	This Plate Plunder is even better\nthan I dreamed!
Enemy_StgWin_233	Pwincess's orders are absolute!\nWe obey them completely!
Enemy_StgWin_234	I'm used to not eating salmon\nand tuna now. It's so last year.
Enemy_StgWin_235	My victory here buys Pwincess\ntime to sleep in longer!
Enemy_StgWin_236	I'll guard this shrine with my life\nuntil Pwincess says otherwise!
Enemy_StgWin_237	Maybe Purrsilla's fops couldn't\nstop you, but I can!
Enemy_StgWin_238	Yikes. The captain would've\nbeen furious if you got through.
Enemy_StgWin_239	You lose, which means you're\nnot going anywhere, kid.
Enemy_StgWin_240	I got off to a late start, but the\nshrine is secure at last!
Enemy_StgWin_249	Hey, look at that. I won.\nDid the sushi sprite show up?
Enemy_StgWin_250	Wow, I actually won! Captain,\ndo you see the sushi sprite?
Enemy_StgWin_251	I won! I won! So why hasn't\nthe sushi sprite appeared?!
Enemy_StgWin_252	There's that sprite. Thanks for\nthe helping hand, Musashi!
Enemy_StgWin_253	You disrespect the Empire if you\nthought you could beat me!
Enemy_StgWin_254	Now that I beat Musashi, no\none has to know I screwed up!
Enemy_StgWin_255	The sushi sprite doesn't matter!\nMy priority is beating YOU!
Enemy_StgWin_256	The cold couldn't keep me from\nbeating you! But I'm still cold...
Enemy_StgWin_257	Now then, back to looking for\nthe shrine buried in the snow.
Enemy_StgWin_258	The shrine is ours! Hands off!
Enemy_StgWin_259	I haven't had a sushi battle in\na while. Guess I've still got it!
Enemy_StgWin_260	Fight's over! Back to stealth\ntraining! Wheeeee!
Enemy_StgWin_261	Now that that's over, I gotta\nhide again or they'll find me!
Enemy_StgWin_262	One more time! I won't rest\nuntil I'm satisfied!
Enemy_StgWin_263	Hee! I was in a bad mood, but\nbeating you cheered me up!
Enemy_StgWin_264	I liked beating you so much,\nI kinda wanna do it again!
Enemy_StgWin_265	My muscles are the perfect\ncomplement to this scenery!
Enemy_StgWin_266	Now what? Investigate the\nshrine or some weightlifting?
Enemy_StgWin_267	Now, where has that missing\nmuscleman gone?
Enemy_StgWin_268	They call me Pandaber, sage\nof sushi and muscle!
Enemy_StgWin_269	The Empire has declared this\narea off-limits! Turn back now!
Enemy_StgWin_270	I'm not letting some random kid\nget into a top-secret shrine!
Enemy_StgWin_271	Muahaha... Tremble before\nthe power of Chamelva...
Enemy_StgWin_272	Is this all you had? I expected\na much harder fight from you.
Enemy_StgWin_273	Teehee! Did I go a teensy bit\noverboard?
Enemy_StgWin_274	Winner, winner! I'm stronger\nthan I even knew!
Enemy_StgWin_275	Wh-what? I won? Really?!\nIt's ABOUT TIME!
Enemy_StgWin_276	My every victory comes from\nextensive training, you know.
Enemy_StgWin_277	Hahahah! In your face, Musashi!
Enemy_StgWin_278	You still have delusions of\ngrandeur, but I can fix that.
Enemy_StgWin_279	Yikes... A breeze nearly blew\nup my robes. That was close!
Enemy_StgWin_280	You'd fight me again after the\nlast time we met? You're a fool.
Enemy_StgWin_281	I win... But I'm still hungry\nfor more sushi...
Enemy_StgWin_282	Hah! Looks like my calves had\nyou spellbound!
Enemy_StgWin_283	As vanquished foes go, you\nwere one of the better ones.
Enemy_StgWin_284	Still can't hold your wasabi, eh?\nYeahhhh, most little kids can't.
Enemy_StgWin_285	That's it? No tricks up your\nsleeve? I had hoped for more.
Enemy_StgWin_286	Cower before the Magnetic\nShot's overwhelming power!
Enemy_StgWin_287	Wow! This other Musashi's not\nvery good, huh?
Enemy_StgWin_288	Winning here is a nice payback\nfor you beating me last time!
Enemy_StgWin_289	If you can't defeat me, how\ncan you overthrow the Empire?
Enemy_StgWin_290	What's wrong, Musashi? You\nseem weaker than usual today!
Enemy_StgWin_291	I'll present you to Pwincess in\nthe hopes that she praises me.
Enemy_StgWin_292	I don't know how I won, but\nI'm sure not complaining!
Enemy_StgWin_293	What happened, my child?\nHave you lost your fire?
Enemy_StgWin_294	That was close... I almost got\nso excited that my mask fell off!
Enemy_StgWin_295	No brat who can't eat sushi\nright is gonna bring me down!
Enemy_StgWin_296	Down in the dumps, huh? Your\nmoves weren't as slick as usual.
Enemy_StgWin_297	Those plates you throw don't\nmake a dent in my thick hide!
Enemy_StgWin_298	No mewling, salmon-eating\nchild will get the better of me!
Enemy_StgWin_299	If that's all you got, then this\nwar might never end.
Enemy_StgWin_300	Target defeated! I should let\nthe general know of my victory.
Enemy_StgWin_301	It's over already? More time\nfor me to eat, then...
Enemy_StgWin_302	I knew you couldn't measure up\nto the REAL Musashi!
Enemy_StgLose_001	How did a kid take me apart?!\nThis is so humiliating!
Enemy_StgLose_002	I'm not supposed to lose! I'm a\ncaptain! Who is this kid?!
Enemy_StgLose_003	No fair! Only cheaters use\nlane-drive gears!
Enemy_StgLose_004	Even with Sweets Paradise on\nmy side, I managed to lose...
Enemy_StgLose_005	Why didn't my Electrozap\nfinish you off?!
Enemy_StgLose_006	I don't understand! My Sushi\nShield has never failed me!
Enemy_StgLose_007	How did you keep up with\nRunaway Lanes?!
Enemy_StgLose_008	Hmph... Serves me right for\ngoing easy on a child.
Enemy_StgLose_009	Wait... Does brute force not\nalways win?
Enemy_StgLose_010	Maybe I shouldn't have\nexplained how capsules work...
Enemy_StgLose_011	So...you figured out "special"\nreferred to the special lane.
Enemy_StgLose_012	Even the mighty Hunter Division\ncouldn't stop you...
Enemy_StgLose_013	I lost again? Even with the\nEmpire backing me up?!
Enemy_StgLose_014	Brrrr... I-it's so cold all of\na sudden...
Enemy_StgLose_015	This kid doesn't have a single\nmuscle, and I'm the loser here?
Enemy_StgLose_016	I thought all that working out\nwas so I'd be ready for this!
Enemy_StgLose_017	Buh?! But I'm the squad\ncaptain! I'm too cut to lose!
Enemy_StgLose_018	Aaaaargh! Don't you know\nthey'll fire me for this?!
Enemy_StgLose_019	Nrrrrgh... Sushi Shuffle\nshould've worked!
Enemy_StgLose_020	Musashi... I underestimated\nyour sushi striking skills.
Enemy_StgLose_021	I wouldn't have fought you at all\nif Celia hadn't screwed up!
Enemy_StgLose_022	You got by Celia, and...I guess\nyou're getting by me too.
Enemy_StgLose_023	No wonder Celia couldn't stop\nyou. I need to tell the captain!
Enemy_StgLose_024	So much for my squad. It's all\nup to that girl now.
Enemy_StgLose_025	I lost...again? Where do you\nfind this strength?
Enemy_StgLose_026	Nooooooooo! My muscles are\ngonna deflate!
Enemy_StgLose_027	But... But I had perfect pecs.\nThey were perfectorals...
Enemy_StgLose_028	I thought I could stop Musashi,\nBut I was just too wishy-washy.
Enemy_StgLose_029	The Empire could use someone\nas ripped as you!
Enemy_StgLose_030	You want to be...friends?\nAre you as stupid as you look?
Enemy_StgLose_031	But... Buff Buffet shoulda\ncleaned your clock...
Enemy_StgLose_032	*cough* *hack* My throat is\ntoo sore to eat sushi now...
Enemy_StgLose_033	I could've beat you if my eyes\nweren't so dry.
Enemy_StgLose_034	Unnnghhh... My nose was too\nstuffy to taste the sushi...
Enemy_StgLose_035	My head is swimming... Maybe\nI should've taken the day off.
Enemy_StgLose_036	You're on the ball today!
Enemy_StgLose_037	Eww, you're so mean! I hope\nAusprey puts you in your place!
Enemy_StgLose_038	Owww! Are you trying to make\na lady cry?!
Enemy_StgLose_039	Couldn't you have gone just\na teeny bit easier on me?
Enemy_StgLose_040	How am I supposed to face\nhot stuff now?
Enemy_StgLose_041	Oh, come on! How did you\nsurvive Tubble-Edged Lanes?!
Enemy_StgLose_042	Hmph. Beaten by a kid who \ncan't even handle his wasabi.
Enemy_StgLose_042_f	Hmph. Beaten by a kid who \ncan't even handle her wasabi.
Enemy_StgLose_043	It seems I lose. Guess I didn't\nlove wasabi enough.
Enemy_StgLose_044	Not enough... I needed more\nwasaaaabiiiiiii!
Enemy_StgLose_045	As long...as there is sushi...\nthere will be wasabi... Urrghh...
Enemy_StgLose_046	InTENSE! You can really sling\nthat soosh!
Enemy_StgLose_047	Awww. Why'd I have to lose?
Enemy_StgLose_048	And here I hoped I'd get to play\nhide-and-seek with Ausprey...
Enemy_StgLose_049	I'll be fine...once Ausprey gives\nme a massage, that is!
Enemy_StgLose_050	You're stronger than you look!\nBe nice, OK?
Enemy_StgLose_051	But...I was so close to getting\na promotion!
Enemy_StgLose_052	Ungh... You're not bad, if you\ncould stand that much wasabi.
Enemy_StgLose_053	You'll be sorry when you meet\nDread General Tiburon's squad!
Enemy_StgLose_054	I wouldn't have lost if any good\nsushi ever came down the lane!
Enemy_StgLose_055	They were right to warn us to\ntake a little kid seriously...
Enemy_StgLose_056	There's stronger than me up\nahead. You'd better stay alert.
Enemy_StgLose_057	Woo! You always put on\na good show!
Enemy_StgLose_058	You were supposed to fall to\nTiburon's handpicked soldiers!
Enemy_StgLose_059	How dare you make a monkey\nof me in front of my squad!
Enemy_StgLose_060	Don't get a swelled head just\nbecause you beat me!
Enemy_StgLose_061	How could one SLF soldier\ntake out an elite squad?!
Enemy_StgLose_062	The Imperial Magnetic Shot has\nnever failed before!
Enemy_StgLose_063	I was sure the Magnetic Shot\nwould buy me more time!
Enemy_StgLose_064	I may have lost, but you'll never\nget through our tight formation!
Enemy_StgLose_065	I hate to say it, but...watching\nyou eat makes me hungry...
Enemy_StgLose_066	You can defeat a captain, but a\ncannon is another story!
Enemy_StgLose_067	Forgive me, Dread General.\nI failed in my mission.
Enemy_StgLose_068	Ugh... I'd almost composed the\ntoast I'd make to your defeat...
Enemy_StgLose_069	Urrrgh... You'd have been a\ncakewalk if not for my bad hip.
Enemy_StgLose_070	I love sushi with all my heart...\nfor all the good it did me.
Enemy_StgLose_071	You're too late. Dread General\nTiburon has already left by now.
Enemy_StgLose_072	You held your own against\nGourai. I clearly misjudged you.
Enemy_StgLose_073	No! My methods have been\ncarefully honed in battle!
Enemy_StgLose_074	The SLF has gone unacceptably\nfar. You must be stopped!
Enemy_StgLose_075	So you're Musashi. Did I do\nsomething to upset you?
Enemy_StgLose_076	P-please! Spare me the\nfinishing blow!
Enemy_StgLose_077	S-so this is it... This is what\ndefeat tastes like...
Enemy_StgLose_078	Whoa! You're a natural at\nthe soosh sports!
Enemy_StgLose_079	Pwincess will scold me for this.\nI'll have her undivided attention!
Enemy_StgLose_080	Oh, Pwincess! No punishment is\ntoo good for the likes of me!
Enemy_StgLose_081	I lost! I looooost! Will I feel her\nglove across my face?!
Enemy_StgLose_082	I lost on purpose to hear the\nsweet music of her scolding!
Enemy_StgLose_083	There's NO WAY you got past\nmy Combo Wall fair and square!
Enemy_StgLose_084	All I wanted was a salmon!\nJust one salmon!
Enemy_StgLose_085	My apologies, Pwincess.\nThe salmon was too strong...
Enemy_StgLose_086	I-I guess our options are pretty\nlimited without salmon, huh?
Enemy_StgLose_087	Wh-what?! Is this a salmon\nthat I see before me?!
Enemy_StgLose_088	Solid soosh! Thanks a mil!
Enemy_StgLose_089	Stop! You mustn't interfere with\nPwincess's dessert time!
Enemy_StgLose_090	If only I had accompanied\nPwincess to her spa instead!
Enemy_StgLose_091	D-don't tell Pwincess...but I'm\ncraving some tuna now.
Enemy_StgLose_092	P-perfection! Maybe you could\nbe the one to help Pwincess...
Enemy_StgLose_093	Just what's your beef with me,\nhuh?! Waaaaaaaah!
Enemy_StgLose_094	It hardly seems right that you\nwithstood my Luxury Flash.
Enemy_StgLose_095	So what if you did get past me?\nYou'll only freeze on that peak!
Enemy_StgLose_096	Glad that's over! Time for me to\nhurry back and get warmed up!
Enemy_StgLose_097	First my heater broke, and now\nyou beat me? Today sucks!
Enemy_StgLose_098	The cold couldn't break me...\nbut you could. Good job?
Enemy_StgLose_099	I didn't get sent all the way out\nhere to let a kid take me apart!
Enemy_StgLose_100	The weather never bothered me\nbefore, but now...
Enemy_StgLose_101	I-I see you've put some\nmuscle on...
Enemy_StgLose_102	All I've done since last time is\nwork out, and I wasn't ready...
Enemy_StgLose_103	The power squad...has been\noverpowered. Bravo, Musashi.
Enemy_StgLose_104	That word "old" stuck with me\nthrough the entire fight...
Enemy_StgLose_105	AAAUUUURRGH! Even all that\nwasabi training was for nothing!
Enemy_StgLose_106	Musashi beat me again... Time\nto say bye-bye to my muscles.
Enemy_StgLose_107	This is the end of the line for\nme and my perfectorals...
Enemy_StgLose_108	Beaten again in a sushi tussle.\nI surrender the way of muscle.
Enemy_StgLose_109	I haven't given up! We'll make\nyou ripped and shredded yet!
Enemy_StgLose_110	I tried to drive out the intruder,\nbut the opposite happened...
Enemy_StgLose_111	My buffet wasn't buff enough.\nI need...more jaw strength...
Enemy_StgLose_112	You did well to defeat me. But\nI'm the weakest of my squad!
Enemy_StgLose_113	I'm not surprised that you beat\nme, the weakest of my squad.
Enemy_StgLose_114	I could never have stopped you.\nNot when I'm the weakest one.
Enemy_StgLose_115	I should never have made\ncaptain... Not when I'mâ€”
Enemy_StgLose_116	I get a kick out of soosh sports\nwith you every time!
Enemy_StgLose_117	Sure, you beat me, but you'll\nnever get past Sleeper!
Enemy_StgLose_118	I-I lost... But Sawfish is next,\nand he'll thrash you for sure!
Enemy_StgLose_119	I couldn't live up to the hype...\nBut our captain never fails!
Enemy_StgLose_120	When the squad captain loses,\nwho's left to threaten you with?
Enemy_StgLose_121	C-captain! The Magnetic Shot's\nall busted up!
Enemy_StgLose_122	I lost... Maybe Kodiak's squad\nhad the right idea.
Enemy_StgLose_123	Urk... Should I use wasabi as a\nweapon, like Ausprey's troops?
Enemy_StgLose_124	I should've tried Purrsilla's way\nof blocking salmon... Yeah...
Enemy_StgLose_125	*sigh* I'm not stylish enough to\ncut it next to Tiburon's people.
Enemy_StgLose_126	What beautiful sushi style! I'd\nexpect no less from Tiburon's...
Enemy_StgLose_127	May the faith I've placed in\nsushi always serve Tiburon!
Enemy_StgLose_128	Does everyone in Tiburon's\nline eat so beautifully?
Enemy_StgLose_129	Only one who eats with such\nrare grace could best us...
Enemy_StgLose_130	It seems Master Musashi is far\nbeyond the Magnetic Shot now.
Enemy_StgLose_131	I'm so proud of you. I thought\nI had nothing left to learn...
Enemy_StgLose_132	Musashi... You must be\nstopped...
Enemy_StgLose_133	Stop, Musashi... Nothing awaits\nyou but your end...
Enemy_StgLose_134	I failed to hold... I... I failed\nto hold!
Enemy_StgLose_135	My deepest apologies, Emperor.\nI will pay for my failure...
Enemy_StgLose_136	Musashi and my old pal make\nfor one titanic team-up!
Enemy_StgLose_137	A youth like you should learn\nyour place...
Enemy_StgLose_138	How can your small body hold\nsuch power?!
Enemy_StgLose_139	No... The Emperor's Sushi\nStranglehold Scheme...
Enemy_StgLose_140	I can't allow you to reach\nEmperor Octavius's chamber!
Enemy_StgLose_141	You fool... The Empire's plan\nis the only way...
Enemy_StgLose_142	To lose to both father and\nchild... What a disgrace...
Enemy_StgLose_143	Our supreme vision of endless\neating... Almost...there...
Enemy_StgLose_144	Don't you take...one step\ncloser...to our Emperor...
Enemy_StgLose_145	Why? Sushi belongs to me...\nYour sushi should be mine too...
Enemy_StgLose_146	How... How can you smile at\nthe taste of sushi?
Enemy_StgLose_197	Ugh... If only I could get that\nrock from you!
Enemy_StgLose_198	You don't have the stones to\ngimme that rock...
Enemy_StgLose_199	Argh... I was supposed to stop\nyou from reaching that shrine!
Enemy_StgLose_200	Where did you even hear about\nthat shrine?! It was a secret!
Enemy_StgLose_201	You looked directly at my\nmuscles without flinching?!
Enemy_StgLose_202	Good workout! Time to hit\nthe showers!
Enemy_StgLose_203	But...the captain said I was the\nstrongest one in the squad!
Enemy_StgLose_204	How could the squad's best\nsoldier lose so easily?!
Enemy_StgLose_205	No! The captain assured me\nthat I was the squad MVP!
Enemy_StgLose_206	My self-esteem-boosting project\nfailed... But we have the gear!
Enemy_StgLose_209	It only gets harder from here...\nI tried to spare you!
Enemy_StgLose_210	Why are you so deep in Imperial\nterritory? What's going on?
Enemy_StgLose_211	Please don't tell me you're\ngoing into the military labs...
Enemy_StgLose_212	You can't do this! Progress\nmarches on!
Enemy_StgLose_213	The captain told me I was weak,\nso my heart wasn't in it.
Enemy_StgLose_214	The captain told me I was weak,\nso I wanted to prove him wrong!
Enemy_StgLose_215	The captain awarded me Least\nValuable Soldier. So humiliating!
Enemy_StgLose_216	My negative reinforcement\nfailed. Maybe...I was weak...
Enemy_StgLose_217	Even the Magnetic Shot didn't\nfaze him... We're doomed!
Enemy_StgLose_217_f	Even the Magnetic Shot didn't\nfaze her... We're doomed!
Enemy_StgLose_218	It's all ruined! This whole lab\nis a lost cause!
Enemy_StgLose_219	I-impossible... How could I let\nthe gear be taken from me?!
Enemy_StgLose_221	The rare sushi sprite is a closely\nheld secret. No one is to know.
Enemy_StgLose_222	There's nothing to see here!\nJust run along home! Please!
Enemy_StgLose_223	Boy, am I ever gonna get a\ntalking-to from the captain.
Enemy_StgLose_224	I can't believe you went and\nbroke my pledge plate...
Enemy_StgLose_225	Waaah... I got in trouble...
Enemy_StgLose_226	Enough sushi striking! I'm going\nto hit the beach instead!
Enemy_StgLose_227	Awww! I promised the captain\nI wouldn't let anyone through!
Enemy_StgLose_228	You got through Plate Plunder?\nOK, you deserve that sprite.
Enemy_StgLose_233	How can I bear to face our\nPwincess now?
Enemy_StgLose_234	True Purrsilla soldiers never eat\nsalmon, even when all is lost.
Enemy_StgLose_235	Our stalling for time here allows\nour Pwincess to visit the spa!
Enemy_StgLose_236	So it's true? Our Pwincess\ntruly has abandoned us?
Enemy_StgLose_237	Ugh. Purrsilla's squad should\nhave taken care of you already!
Enemy_StgLose_238	You can't go on ahead! You...\nYou just can't, OK?!
Enemy_StgLose_239	I saw a strange sprite that way!\nShouldn't you check it out?!
Enemy_StgLose_240	Ugh... I was late getting out of\nbed, and look where it got me.
Enemy_StgLose_249	Oof. That's gonna leave a mark.\nAny sign of the sushi sprite?
Enemy_StgLose_250	Where's the sushi sprite? Was\nour fight not flashy enough?!
Enemy_StgLose_251	I thought about throwing the\nfight, but you're way too good.
Enemy_StgLose_252	I may have lost the battle, but\nI...also lost...the war... Hmm.
Enemy_StgLose_253	Why do you insist on going\nwhere you're not allowed?!
Enemy_StgLose_254	My big mouth probably just\nearned me a demotion...
Enemy_StgLose_255	You seem to have a sixth sense\nfor the location of sushi sprites.
Enemy_StgLose_256	This freezing weather... Hey, are\nmy lips turning blue?
Enemy_StgLose_257	The shrine is buried under all\nthis snow. Good luck finding it!
Enemy_StgLose_258	Well, you found the shrine.\nDo whatever you want with it.
Enemy_StgLose_259	I haven't had a sushi battle in a\nwhile. Guess I'm pretty rusty.
Enemy_StgLose_260	With nothing to do here, we\ntook up stealth training.
Enemy_StgLose_261	Ugh... If I don't get up, the one\nwho's "it" will find me...
Enemy_StgLose_262	I demand a rematch! Oh, who\nam I kidding...
Enemy_StgLose_263	I wanted a break, but I guess\nI got broken.
Enemy_StgLose_264	You're so strong, even my\nmuscles sit up and take notice!
Enemy_StgLose_265	And I thought I had the perfect\nquiet spot to do a few reps...
Enemy_StgLose_266	I'll look for the shrine in a\nminute. My muscles come first!
Enemy_StgLose_267	First that one muscle head went\nmissing, and now this!
Enemy_StgLose_268	I have surpassed muscle and\nsushi... Huh? Wh-where am I?
Enemy_StgLose_269	What is it that drives you\nforward so relentlessly?!
Enemy_StgLose_270	You're more than some unruly\nchild. Fine. You may proceed.
Enemy_StgLose_271	GYAAAAH! How could you have\nbeaten Chamelva?!
Enemy_StgLose_272	Hm? I'm not sure I understand\nwhat just happened.
Enemy_StgLose_273	What a meanie! Don't you know\nit hurts to lose?
Enemy_StgLose_274	You seem WAY stronger now.\nDid you grow a few inches?
Enemy_StgLose_275	You're not supposed to be THIS\ngood! What gives?!
Enemy_StgLose_276	Where did I err? I must analyze\nmy tactics for any flaws...
Enemy_StgLose_277	Shouldn't I be creaming you?!\nGuess you're not such a runt...
Enemy_StgLose_278	You're still a child, but you've\nimproved by leaps and bounds.
Enemy_StgLose_279	M-my cloak is falling off! \nDon't you dare look under it!
Enemy_StgLose_280	Who cares who won? War never\nsolved anything anyway.
Enemy_StgLose_281	I lost? That makes me hungry\nfor sushi...
Enemy_StgLose_282	What was the weak link? It was\nmy calf muscles, right?
Enemy_StgLose_283	So you're the one they call\nMusashi. You have bright eyes...
Enemy_StgLose_284	You understand the appeal of\nwasabi now, eh? Very mature!
Enemy_StgLose_285	Perfection... Your skill reminds\nme of Tiburon in his youth. 
Enemy_StgLose_286	So the SLF's secret weapon\nhas bested the Empire's...
Enemy_StgLose_287	Who are you supposed to be?\nWhat theâ€” You're Musashi too?
Enemy_StgLose_288	Did I fight you the other day,\nor was that my imagination?
Enemy_StgLose_289	Rrgh... I wanted to take back\nthe SLF, but I'm powerless...
Enemy_StgLose_290	You've gotten strong! What's\nyour workout plan like?
Enemy_StgLose_291	Heavens no! Pwincess mustn't\nfind out, or I'll get a scolding!
Enemy_StgLose_292	Hold up! No one could throw\nTHAT many plates! Come on!
Enemy_StgLose_293	You're like meâ€”no hesitation\non the sushi battlefield.
Enemy_StgLose_294	Hissss... Your endless stream of\nplates nearly broke my mask...
Enemy_StgLose_295	I couldn't take a brat who\nwouldn't eat wasabi seriously!
Enemy_StgLose_296	Good game! You were really\non the ball today!
Enemy_StgLose_297	Dang. I'm so pumped I couldn't\neven see past my muscles!
Enemy_StgLose_298	You dare use salmon against\nme? Don't you know who I am?
Enemy_StgLose_299	You're obviously powerful.\nShow me how you do it.
Enemy_StgLose_300	Only General Tiburon can deal\nwith a menace like you...
Enemy_StgLose_301	Don't throw plates, throw sushi.\nThat's what I'm hungry for...
Enemy_StgLose_302	Well, that was weird! So you're\nanother Musashi?

Player_StgWin_001	This is sushi striking, huh?\nI'm loving it already!
Player_StgWin_002	Another victory, another belly\nfull of sushi!
Player_StgWin_003	You're just mad because you\ndon't have one, Kojiro!
Player_StgWin_004	I love sweets almost as much\nas I love sushi!
Player_StgWin_005	I've had static cling worse than\nyour Electrozap!
Player_StgWin_006	My sushi striking can bust\nthrough any shield!
Player_StgWin_007	Wow! Talk about a fast-\npaced fight!
Player_StgWin_008	NOW are you gonna stop\ntreating me like a kid?!
Player_StgWin_009	You know your attacks are all\nreally obvious, right?
Player_StgWin_010	Capsules sure are neat! Thanks\nfor letting me have so many!
Player_StgWin_011	You specialize so much that you\nforgot all the basics!
Player_StgWin_012	Yesss! Nothing's standing in\nmy way now!
Player_StgWin_013	I'll never join the Empire!\nDon't bother asking again!
Player_StgWin_014	Put a shirt on already!
Player_StgWin_015	I'm the better striker! Though I\ndo wish I had cool muscles...
Player_StgWin_016	What does working out have to\ndo with sushi striking?
Player_StgWin_017	Your rank and your build don't\nmatter if you're in my way!
Player_StgWin_018	Sorry about getting you fired!\nMaybe just leave the Empire?
Player_StgWin_019	Shuffle the sushi all you wantâ€”\nI'm going to eat it all anyway!
Player_StgWin_020	That girl looks like she's\nmy age... That's so sad.
Player_StgWin_021	Just let me through! I need to\nsee that girl again!
Player_StgWin_022	I won, so get lost! You're\nstanding in my way!
Player_StgWin_023	Is this the way Celia went?
Player_StgWin_024	Celia's gotta be up ahead\nsomewhere...
Player_StgWin_025	I hope I'm starting to get\nthrough to Celia...
Player_StgWin_026	Muscles don't deflate! Stop\ntalking nonsense and go away!
Player_StgWin_027	"Perfectorals"? One of us has\na lot to learn about anatomy...
Player_StgWin_028	Wow. Did I beat you so bad that\nyou burst into poetry?
Player_StgWin_029	I'll pass. I don't need muscles\nOR the Empire!
Player_StgWin_030	I'm not stupid! Just listen to\nme for a minute!
Player_StgWin_031	You'll never really appreciate\nsushi with that dumb skill!
Player_StgWin_032	Are you catching a cold?\nDude, go get some bed rest!
Player_StgWin_033	Then you should've used some\neye drops before the fight!
Player_StgWin_034	Aw, that's no fun. You can't\nfight without enjoying the sushi!
Player_StgWin_035	How come everyone in this\nsquad looks ready to barf?!
Player_StgWin_036	I'm getting the hang of this\nstuff! Good soosh, buddy!
Player_StgWin_037	Do you have a thing for the\nold guy or something?
Player_StgWin_038	Yeah, right! Those are just big\nold crocodile tears!
Player_StgWin_039	No! Because then you'd\nhave won!
Player_StgWin_040	Well... Would it help if I was\nright there with you?
Player_StgWin_041	I just got out of the way.\nIt wasn't hard.
Player_StgWin_042	Just because I can't eat wasabi\ndoesn't make me a little kid!
Player_StgWin_043	It's sushi you're supposed to\nlove! Wasabi's just a condiment.
Player_StgWin_044	No, what YOU need is an\nintervention!
Player_StgWin_045	I think all that wasabi has gone\nto your brain.
Player_StgWin_046	You're not so bad yourself!
Player_StgWin_047	Sorry about that, but I need to\nmove on ahead!
Player_StgWin_048	If you want, I can come back\nlater and we can play instead!
Player_StgWin_049	Oh, is your back stiff? Do you\nwant me to try pounding it?
Player_StgWin_050	I'm nice to everyone who's not\nan Imperial soldier!
Player_StgWin_051	I don't really see that\nhappening for you. Ever.
Player_StgWin_052	Is a taste for wasabi the secret\nto being an adult? Teach me!
Player_StgWin_053	Is that the guy who's supposed\nto be the best of the best?
Player_StgWin_054	Then try not being so picky!
Player_StgWin_055	Looks like they forgot to warn\nyou not to call me a little kid!
Player_StgWin_056	Thanks for the warning,\nmister!
Player_StgWin_057	What do you expect from a\nsuperstrong soosh striker?
Player_StgWin_058	You and your squad had better\nget used to it!
Player_StgWin_059	Better to be a monkey than an\nImperial goon!
Player_StgWin_060	You say that, but if you'd beat\nme, I bet you'd be the worst...
Player_StgWin_061	Maybe now you'll admit you\nguys aren't all that great!
Player_StgWin_062	There's a first time for\neverything!
Player_StgWin_063	You thought wrong! I'm gonna\nclear a path right to Tiburon!
Player_StgWin_064	Ohhh, so that's why everyone's\nstanding so close together!
Player_StgWin_065	That's real sushi for you! You're\nsupposed to eat it with a smile!
Player_StgWin_066	What, that huge thing? I'm used\nto it by now!
Player_StgWin_067	You can sulk later! Right now\nyou gotta let me through!
Player_StgWin_068	"Almost"? How hard can it be\nto make toast?
Player_StgWin_069	Bad hips, trick knees, sore\nbacks... I've heard it all before!
Player_StgWin_070	If it helps, I could tell by the\nway you fought!
Player_StgWin_071	I'll believe that when I see it!\nLet me through!
Player_StgWin_072	Heck yeah you did! So uh, why\naren't you acting like you lost?
Player_StgWin_073	Your "methods" don't matter!\nSushi is more than a method!
Player_StgWin_074	You say that, but I'm going on\nahead anyway!
Player_StgWin_075	You knew my name? Wow!\nAm I getting famous?!
Player_StgWin_076	"Finishing blow"? I'm not gonna\nhurt you! I'm the good guy!
Player_StgWin_077	I'd taste sushi over defeat any\nday, that's for sure!
Player_StgWin_078	Soosh? Sports? You make my\nhead hurt...
Player_StgWin_079	Wait, is he happy he's going to\nget yelled at?!
Player_StgWin_080	Wh-what a weirdo...
Player_StgWin_081	Are that lady's troops OK?\nIn the head, I mean...
Player_StgWin_082	This captain's even further gone\nthan his crew!
Player_StgWin_083	Sure, it wasn't easy, but I\ncouldn't give up, right?
Player_StgWin_084	Sounds like that Purrsilla lady\nwon't let him have any...
Player_StgWin_085	It's not just salmon! Some of\nit's tuna, too!
Player_StgWin_086	Quit being stubborn and eat\nsome already!
Player_StgWin_087	Wow. You're so hungry for\nsalmon you're hallucinating...
Player_StgWin_088	A mill? But we're eating rice,\nnot flour... I'm confused.
Player_StgWin_089	So she's eating bonbons while\nyou're out here fighting?!
Player_StgWin_090	Oh, is that why your mind never\nseemed to be on the fight?
Player_StgWin_091	Ouch... Even her loyal soldiers\nare having a tough time.
Player_StgWin_092	Help her? With what?
Player_StgWin_093	My beef with you?! Listen, YOU\npicked a fight with ME!
Player_StgWin_094	Good sushi wins out over any\nskill, no matter how tricky!
Player_StgWin_095	Aaaaachoooo! Y-you might\nhave a point there...
Player_StgWin_096	Y-y-you're being a good sport\nabout this. You deserve a rest!
Player_StgWin_097	Between the two, I'd be more\nworried about your heater...
Player_StgWin_098	Why do I feel even worse now?
Player_StgWin_099	Wow, you're even mad about\nthe same thing as before!
Player_StgWin_100	Oh, right! Still haven't put a\nshirt on, huh?
Player_StgWin_101	Sure! Can't really help it with all\nthe fighting I've been through!
Player_StgWin_102	Someday you'll learn there's\nmore to life than exercise!
Player_StgWin_103	Thanks! I think?
Player_StgWin_104	Hey, I call it like I see it!
Player_StgWin_105	Get real! You don't get strong\nby making yourself suffer!
Player_StgWin_106	The deflating muscles guy!\nDon't beat yourself up, man!
Player_StgWin_107	The "perfectorals" guy too?!\nAre all of Kodiak's guys here?
Player_StgWin_108	I missed your poetry! Ever think\nof doing that full time instead?
Player_StgWin_109	You know, it might actually be\nfun to have bulging muscles...
Player_StgWin_110	Just let me free Franklin and I'll\nbe out of your hair!
Player_StgWin_111	Give it a rest, Kodiak! That's no\nway to eat sushi!
Player_StgWin_112	I-is that true? Well, don't let\nit get you down.
Player_StgWin_113	Huh? But didn't the last guy\nalso say...
Player_StgWin_114	Can't you even come up with\nan original excuse?!
Player_StgWin_115	Don't say you're the weakest\nin your squad! Don't even!
Player_StgWin_116	Fighting you is almost starting\nto feel normal!
Player_StgWin_117	So Sleeper is next... I look\nforward to tangling with him!
Player_StgWin_118	So you're OK with dumping\nthe problem on Sawfish?
Player_StgWin_119	This squad sure seems OK with\npassing the buck!
Player_StgWin_120	It's rough to have all that\nresponsibility on your shoulders.
Player_StgWin_121	Was that your secret weapon?\nSorry I had to go and break it!
Player_StgWin_122	I dunno. All that weight training\nseems like a lot of work...
Player_StgWin_123	Definitely not! I can't stand the\nway it stuffs up my nose!
Player_StgWin_124	It wouldn't have helped. Just\neat whatever sushi you want!
Player_StgWin_125	First you need to believe in\nsushi. Style will come later.
Player_StgWin_126	Sushi style? You mean the way\nI eat sushi? That's kinda cool!
Player_StgWin_127	You really love sushi... Dad\nhas good people under him.
Player_StgWin_128	I dunno about everyone, but it's\ndefinitely true for me!
Player_StgWin_129	You're just another stepping\nstone on the way to my dad!
Player_StgWin_130	Soldiers, cannons... Put 'em in\nmy way and I'll knock 'em out!
Player_StgWin_131	I'm glad I got a chance to show\nyou my love for sushi!
Player_StgWin_132	Wh-what's with the mask?\nYou're creeping me out...
Player_StgWin_133	"Your end"? Don't make\nme laugh!
Player_StgWin_134	Uhhh, are you broken? I'll...\nbe moving along now...
Player_StgWin_135	This is the least fun squad to\nbe around I've ever met!
Player_StgWin_136	You're even here in the palace?\nJust what's your deal, huh?!
Player_StgWin_137	Aww, get stuffed! My place is\nfighting here alongside my dad!
Player_StgWin_138	I'm just trying to show my dad\nhow far I've come!
Player_StgWin_139	That's what me and my dad are\nhere to stop!
Player_StgWin_140	So what you're saying is, we're\nalmost there? Let's go, Dad!
Player_StgWin_141	I won't accept a world where\nyou guys control the sushi!
Player_StgWin_142	Sorry, I don't have time for your\nwhining! Gotta catch up to Dad!
Player_StgWin_143	It's only endless for you! What\nabout the rest of the world?!
Player_StgWin_144	It's time I met Octavius. We\nneed to have a talk about sushi!
Player_StgWin_145	Sushi doesn't belong to any\none person! It's everyone's!
Player_StgWin_146	Because I picture everyone else\nin the world enjoying it, too!
Player_StgWin_197	It's all mine! If you want one,\nfind it yourself!
Player_StgWin_198	Dude... You lost, and you're\nstill making terrible puns?
Player_StgWin_199	A shrine, huh? Is that where the\nlane-drive gear engineer is?
Player_StgWin_200	Heheh! No secret is safe with\nArchie around!
Player_StgWin_201	Yeah! Why, are they supposed\nto be scary?
Player_StgWin_202	You have fun! I'll just be on\nmy way...
Player_StgWin_203	Don't believe everything\nyou hear!
Player_StgWin_204	It's weird, but I feel like I've\nheard that before.
Player_StgWin_205	You and everyone else in his\ncommand, apparently!
Player_StgWin_206	So that was their plan! Still,\nI'm getting that gear back!
Player_StgWin_209	It doesn't matter! Sushi will\ncarry me past any obstacle!
Player_StgWin_210	There's a suspicious experiment\nhere that I'll put a stop to!
Player_StgWin_211	I sure am! I'm gonna get back\nwhat you stole!
Player_StgWin_212	It'll have to march on without\nthat gear, then!
Player_StgWin_213	Don't believe that guy! Listen\nto your sushi-loving heart!
Player_StgWin_214	You don't have to prove youâ€”\nWait, this sounds familiar.
Player_StgWin_215	This guy sounds like the worst\nleader I've ever heard of!
Player_StgWin_216	This whole squad has been\na real downer to fight...
Player_StgWin_217	Why is there a Magnetic Shot\nhere?! What are you guarding?!
Player_StgWin_218	That's what you get for building\nmachines that waste sushi!
Player_StgWin_219	True happiness could never\ncome through a fake sushi gate!
Player_StgWin_221	Hey, I'm not the one who\nbrought it up!
Player_StgWin_222	Hearing you say that just makes\nme more curious!
Player_StgWin_223	I do feel bad about that. Maybe\ntell him I was just too good?
Player_StgWin_224	Sun-o will be happier with\nme anyway!
Player_StgWin_225	S-sorry about that. No hard\nfeelings, OK?
Player_StgWin_226	I'd come with you, but I've got\na rare sushi sprite to find!
Player_StgWin_227	Then that must mean there's\nsomething you were guarding!
Player_StgWin_228	When my plates get stolen,\nI just eat more!
Player_StgWin_233	I told youâ€”Purrsilla isn't even\nhere anymore.
Player_StgWin_234	Did nobody tell you Purrsilla\ndoesn't care about that now?
Player_StgWin_235	He's so dedicated that it almost\nbrings a tear to my eye.
Player_StgWin_236	I didn't want to be the one to\nbreak it to you, but...
Player_StgWin_237	They're not so hard when you\nknow how to handle 'em!
Player_StgWin_238	Well, I am. Try not to be a sore\nloser about it!
Player_StgWin_239	Nice try, but I think I see a\nshrine up ahead!
Player_StgWin_240	Guess it's true what they say:\nyou snooze, you lose!
Player_StgWin_249	Hmmm... I don't see\nanything yet.
Player_StgWin_250	It must've missed the\nwhole thing...
Player_StgWin_251	Believe me, I could tell you\nwere fighting your heart out!
Player_StgWin_252	You can trick me, but there's no\ngetting around my sushi skills!
Player_StgWin_253	What can I say? I hear the sushi\nsprite calling, that's all!
Player_StgWin_254	Just isn't your day, huh?
Player_StgWin_255	A sixth sense is cool, but I like\nto say I have a nose for them!
Player_StgWin_256	Eat some good sushi and you\nwon't even notice the cold!
Player_StgWin_257	It'll be easy! I'll just follow\nmy nose for sushi sprites!
Player_StgWin_258	I will, thanks!
Player_StgWin_259	Yeah, I could see how being\nout here will do that to you.
Player_StgWin_260	This place is so pretty, I'd want\nto lose myself here too.
Player_StgWin_261	Wait... This "stealth training"...\nAre you playing hide-and-seek?!
Player_StgWin_262	I can't tell if he means with me\nor his hide-and-seek soldiers...
Player_StgWin_263	S-sorry about that. Sometimes\nI try a little TOO hard...
Player_StgWin_264	Your muscles have a mind of\ntheir own, huh?
Player_StgWin_265	Did you even notice that we\nhad a sushi battle just now?
Player_StgWin_266	Uhh, how many "minutes" has\nit been now?
Player_StgWin_267	Hope you find your friend!
Player_StgWin_268	Wake up! It's time to come to\nyour senses!
Player_StgWin_269	Where there's Imperials to bust,\nI'll be there doing the busting!
Player_StgWin_270	Is it worse that you called me\n"unruly" or a "child"?!
Player_StgWin_271	Because I focus on sushi,\nnot psychic mumbo jumbo!
Player_StgWin_272	It's easyâ€”I love sushi more than\nyou, so I won!
Player_StgWin_273	Seeing you act so fragile all of\na sudden is weird!
Player_StgWin_274	I'm only as strong as sushi\nmakes me!
Player_StgWin_275	I've fought so many tough\nenemies that I can't help it!
Player_StgWin_276	Wow, you take this stuff pretty\nseriously, huh?
Player_StgWin_277	I've grown a lot as a sushi\nstriker! But you knew that, huh?
Player_StgWin_278	Hey! If I don't get to call you\nold, you can't call me a child!
Player_StgWin_279	I already didn't want to,\nand now I'm scared to!
Player_StgWin_280	You're right. That's why I'm\ntrying to end this war!
Player_StgWin_281	I'm always happy to fight, if it\nhelps you eat!
Player_StgWin_282	If there was a weak link, it was\nyour whole general attitude...
Player_StgWin_283	Thanks for the compliment, but\ndid you really forget my name?!
Player_StgWin_284	Mature? Me? Hey, yeah!\nI AM mature!
Player_StgWin_285	If he was this good then, will I\never be better than him?
Player_StgWin_286	I've taken apart enough of you\nto know how it works by now!
Player_StgWin_287	Is your name also Musashi?\nYou remind me of someone...
Player_StgWin_288	Umm... I don't know, did you?\nI don't remember either.
Player_StgWin_289	The SLF is better off in my\nhands anyway!
Player_StgWin_290	Well, first I eat sushi, and then\nI eat some more!
Player_StgWin_291	Why do I think you're going to\ntell her as soon as you can...
Player_StgWin_292	That's what sushi striking is\nabout! Get with the program!
Player_StgWin_293	I can't afford to hesitate! Not\nwhen it comes to you!
Player_StgWin_294	What's under there, anyway?\nCan I get a quick peek?
Player_StgWin_295	You're as big a brat as me,\nand you have no excuse!
Player_StgWin_296	Thanks! I have to be when I\nfight someone as good as you!
Player_StgWin_297	I think you've been training the\nwrong things...
Player_StgWin_298	There's nothing wrong with tuna\nor salmon! Don't be stubborn!
Player_StgWin_299	I just follow my own path and\nlet sushi be my guide!
Player_StgWin_300	Does that mean you're giving\nup? Seems kinda cowardly!
Player_StgWin_301	B-but we were both eating\nsushi the whole time!
Player_StgWin_302	It's not every day you get to\nfight yourself!
Player_StgWin_001_f	This is sushi striking, huh?\nI'm loving it already!
Player_StgWin_002_f	Another victory, another belly\nfull of sushi!
Player_StgWin_003_f	You're just mad because you\ndon't have one, Kojiro!
Player_StgWin_004_f	I love sweets almost as much\nas I love sushi!
Player_StgWin_005_f	I've had static cling worse than\nyour Electrozap!
Player_StgWin_006_f	My sushi striking can bust\nthrough any shield!
Player_StgWin_007_f	Wow! Talk about a fast-\npaced fight!
Player_StgWin_008_f	NOW are you gonna stop\ntreating me like a kid?!
Player_StgWin_009_f	You know your attacks are all\nreally obvious, right?
Player_StgWin_010_f	Capsules sure are neat! Thanks\nfor letting me have so many!
Player_StgWin_011_f	You specialize so much that you\nforgot all the basics!
Player_StgWin_012_f	Yesss! Nothing's standing in\nmy way now!
Player_StgWin_013_f	I'll never join the Empire!\nDon't bother asking again!
Player_StgWin_014_f	Put a shirt on already!
Player_StgWin_015_f	I'm the better striker! Though I\ndo wish I had cool muscles...
Player_StgWin_016_f	What does working out have to\ndo with sushi striking?
Player_StgWin_017_f	Your rank and your build don't\nmatter if you're in my way!
Player_StgWin_018_f	Sorry about getting you fired!\nMaybe just leave the Empire?
Player_StgWin_019_f	Shuffle the sushi all you wantâ€”\nI'm going to eat it all anyway!
Player_StgWin_020_f	That girl looked like she was\nmy age... That's so sad.
Player_StgWin_021_f	Just let me through! I need to\nsee that girl again!
Player_StgWin_022_f	I won, so get lost! You're\nstanding in my way!
Player_StgWin_023_f	Is this the way Celia went?
Player_StgWin_024_f	Celia's gotta be up ahead\nsomewhere...
Player_StgWin_025_f	I hope I'm starting to get\nthrough to Celia...
Player_StgWin_026_f	Muscles don't deflate! Stop\ntalking nonsense and go away!
Player_StgWin_027_f	"Perfectorals"? One of us has\na lot to learn about anatomy...
Player_StgWin_028_f	Wow. Did I beat you so bad that\nyou burst into poetry?
Player_StgWin_029_f	I'll pass. I don't need muscles\nOR the Empire!
Player_StgWin_030_f	I'm not stupid! Just listen to\nme for a minute!
Player_StgWin_031_f	You'll never really appreciate\nsushi with that dumb skill!
Player_StgWin_032_f	Are you catching a cold?\nDude, go get some bed rest!
Player_StgWin_033_f	Then you should've used some\neye drops before the fight!
Player_StgWin_034_f	Aw, that's no fun. You can't\nfight without enjoying the sushi!
Player_StgWin_035_f	How come everyone in this\nsquad looks ready to barf?!
Player_StgWin_036_f	I'm getting the hang of this\nstuff! Good soosh, buddy!
Player_StgWin_037_f	Do you have a thing for the\nold guy or something?
Player_StgWin_038_f	Yeah, right! Those are just big\nold crocodile tears!
Player_StgWin_039_f	No! Because then you'd\nhave won!
Player_StgWin_040_f	Well... Would it help if I was\nright there with you?
Player_StgWin_041_f	I just got out of the way.\nIt wasn't hard.
Player_StgWin_042_f	Just because I can't eat wasabi\ndoesn't make me a little kid!
Player_StgWin_043_f	It's sushi you're supposed to\nlove! Wasabi's just a condiment.
Player_StgWin_044_f	No, what YOU need is an\nintervention!
Player_StgWin_045_f	I think all that wasabi has gone\nto your brain.
Player_StgWin_046_f	You're not so bad yourself!
Player_StgWin_047_f	Sorry about that, but I need to\nmove on ahead!
Player_StgWin_048_f	If you want, I can come back\nlater and we can play instead!
Player_StgWin_049_f	Oh, is your back stiff? Do you\nwant me to try pounding it?
Player_StgWin_050_f	I'm nice to everyone who's not\nan Imperial soldier!
Player_StgWin_051_f	I don't really see that\nhappening for you. Ever.
Player_StgWin_052_f	Is a taste for wasabi the secret\nto being an adult? Teach me!
Player_StgWin_053_f	Is that the guy who's supposed\nto be the best of the best?
Player_StgWin_054_f	Then try not being so picky!
Player_StgWin_055_f	Looks like they forgot to warn\nyou not to call me a little kid!
Player_StgWin_056_f	Thanks for the warning,\nmister!
Player_StgWin_057_f	What do you expect from a\nsuperstrong soosh striker?
Player_StgWin_058_f	You and your squad had better\nget used to it!
Player_StgWin_059_f	Better to be a monkey than an\nImperial goon!
Player_StgWin_060_f	You say that, but if you'd beat\nme, I bet you'd be the worst...
Player_StgWin_061_f	Maybe now you'll admit you\nguys aren't all that great!
Player_StgWin_062_f	There's a first time for\neverything!
Player_StgWin_063_f	You thought wrong! I'm gonna\nclear a path right to Tiburon!
Player_StgWin_064_f	Ohhh, so that's why everyone's\nstanding so close together!
Player_StgWin_065_f	That's real sushi for you! You're\nsupposed to eat it with a smile!
Player_StgWin_066_f	What, that huge thing? I'm used\nto it by now!
Player_StgWin_067_f	You can sulk later! Right now\nyou gotta let me through!
Player_StgWin_068_f	"Almost"? How hard can it be\nto make toast?
Player_StgWin_069_f	Bad hips, trick knees, sore\nbacks... I've heard it all before!
Player_StgWin_070_f	If it helps, I could tell by the\nway you fought!
Player_StgWin_071_f	I'll believe that when I see it!\nLet me through!
Player_StgWin_072_f	Heck yeah you did! So uh, why\naren't you acting like you lost?
Player_StgWin_073_f	Your "methods" don't matter!\nSushi is more than a method!
Player_StgWin_074_f	You say that, but I'm going on\nahead anyway!
Player_StgWin_075_f	You knew my name? Wow!\nAm I getting famous?!
Player_StgWin_076_f	"Finishing blow"? I'm not gonna\nhurt you! I'm the good guy!
Player_StgWin_077_f	I'd taste sushi over defeat any\nday, that's for sure!
Player_StgWin_078_f	Soosh? Sports? You make my\nhead hurt...
Player_StgWin_079_f	Wait, is he happy he's going to\nget yelled at?!
Player_StgWin_080_f	Wh-what a weirdo...
Player_StgWin_081_f	Are that lady's troops OK?\nIn the head, I mean...
Player_StgWin_082_f	This captain's even further gone\nthan his crew!
Player_StgWin_083_f	Sure, it wasn't easy, but I\ncouldn't give up, right?
Player_StgWin_084_f	Sounds like that Purrsilla lady\nwon't let him have any...
Player_StgWin_085_f	It's not just salmon! Some of\nit's tuna, too!
Player_StgWin_086_f	Quit being stubborn and eat\nsome already!
Player_StgWin_087_f	Wow. You're so hungry for\nsalmon, you're hallucinating...
Player_StgWin_088_f	A mill? But we're eating rice,\nnot flour... I'm confused.
Player_StgWin_089_f	So she's eating bonbons while\nyou're out here fighting?!
Player_StgWin_090_f	Oh, is that why your mind never\nseemed to be on the fight?
Player_StgWin_091_f	Ouch... Even her loyal soldiers\nare having a tough time.
Player_StgWin_092_f	Help her? With what?
Player_StgWin_093_f	My beef with you?! Listen, YOU\npicked a fight with ME!
Player_StgWin_094_f	Good sushi wins out over any\nskill, no matter how tricky!
Player_StgWin_095_f	Aaaaachoooo! Y-you might\nhave a point there...
Player_StgWin_096_f	Y-y-you're being a good sport\nabout this. You deserve a rest!
Player_StgWin_097_f	Between the two, I'd be more\nworried about your heater...
Player_StgWin_098_f	Why do I feel even worse now?
Player_StgWin_099_f	Wow, you're even mad about\nthe same thing as before!
Player_StgWin_100_f	Oh, right! Still haven't put a\nshirt on, huh?
Player_StgWin_101_f	Sure! Can't really help it with all\nthe fighting I've been through!
Player_StgWin_102_f	Someday you'll learn there's\nmore to life than exercise!
Player_StgWin_103_f	Thanks! I think?
Player_StgWin_104_f	Hey, I call it like I see it!
Player_StgWin_105_f	Get real! You don't get strong\nby making yourself suffer!
Player_StgWin_106_f	The deflating muscles guy!\nDon't beat yourself up, man!
Player_StgWin_107_f	The "perfectorals" guy too?!\nAre all of Kodiak's guys here?
Player_StgWin_108_f	I missed your poetry! Ever think\nof doing that full time instead?
Player_StgWin_109_f	You know, it might actually be\nfun to have bulging muscles...
Player_StgWin_110_f	Just let me free Franklin and I'll\nbe out of your hair!
Player_StgWin_111_f	Give it a rest, Kodiak! That's no\nway to eat sushi!
Player_StgWin_112_f	I-is that true? Well, don't let\nit get you down.
Player_StgWin_113_f	Huh? But didn't the last guy\nalso say...
Player_StgWin_114_f	Can't you even come up with\nan original excuse?!
Player_StgWin_115_f	Don't say you're the weakest\nin your squad! Don't even!
Player_StgWin_116_f	Fighting you is almost starting\nto feel normal!
Player_StgWin_117_f	So Sleeper is next... I look\nforward to tangling with him!
Player_StgWin_118_f	So you're OK with dumping\nthe problem on Sawfish?
Player_StgWin_119_f	This squad sure seems OK with\npassing the buck!
Player_StgWin_120_f	It's rough to have all that\nresponsibility on your shoulders.
Player_StgWin_121_f	Was that your secret weapon?\nSorry I had to go and break it!
Player_StgWin_122_f	I dunno. All that weight training\nseems like a lot of work...
Player_StgWin_123_f	Definitely not! I can't stand the\nway it stuffs up my nose!
Player_StgWin_124_f	It wouldn't have helped. Just\neat whatever sushi you want!
Player_StgWin_125_f	First you need to believe in\nsushi. Style will come later.
Player_StgWin_126_f	Sushi style? You mean the way\nI eat sushi? That's kinda cool!
Player_StgWin_127_f	You really love sushi... Dad\nhas good people under him.
Player_StgWin_128_f	I dunno about everyone, but it's\ndefinitely true for me!
Player_StgWin_129_f	You're just another stepping\nstone on the way to my dad!
Player_StgWin_130_f	Soldiers, cannons... Put 'em in\nmy way and I'll knock 'em out!
Player_StgWin_131_f	I'm glad I got a chance to show\nyou my love for sushi!
Player_StgWin_132_f	Wh-what's with the mask?\nYou're creeping me out...
Player_StgWin_133_f	"Your end"? Don't make\nme laugh!
Player_StgWin_134_f	Uhhh, are you broken? I'll...\nbe moving along now...
Player_StgWin_135_f	This is the least fun squad to\nbe around I've ever met!
Player_StgWin_136_f	You're even here in the palace?\nJust what's your deal, huh?!
Player_StgWin_137_f	Aww, get stuffed! My place is\nfighting here alongside my dad!
Player_StgWin_138_f	I'm just trying to show my dad\nhow far I've come!
Player_StgWin_139_f	That's what me and my dad are\nhere to stop!
Player_StgWin_140_f	So what you're saying is, we're\nalmost there? Let's go, Dad!
Player_StgWin_141_f	I won't accept a world where\nyou guys control the sushi!
Player_StgWin_142_f	Sorry, I don't have time for your\nwhining! Gotta catch up to Dad!
Player_StgWin_143_f	It's only endless for you! What\nabout the rest of the world?!
Player_StgWin_144_f	It's time I met Octavius. We\nneed to have a talk about sushi!
Player_StgWin_145_f	Sushi doesn't belong to any\none person! It's everyone's!
Player_StgWin_146_f	Because I picture everyone else\nin the world enjoying it, too!
Player_StgWin_197_f	It's all mine! If you want one,\nfind it yourself!
Player_StgWin_198_f	Dude... You lost, and you're\nstill making terrible puns?
Player_StgWin_199_f	A shrine, huh? Is that where the\nlane-drive gear engineer is?
Player_StgWin_200_f	Heheh! No secret is safe with\nArchie around!
Player_StgWin_201_f	Yeah! Why, are they supposed\nto be scary?
Player_StgWin_202_f	You have fun! I'll just be on\nmy way...
Player_StgWin_203_f	Don't believe everything\nyou hear!
Player_StgWin_204_f	It's weird, but I feel like I've\nheard that before.
Player_StgWin_205_f	You and everyone else in his\ncommand, apparently!
Player_StgWin_206_f	So that was their plan! Still,\nI'm getting that gear back!
Player_StgWin_209_f	It doesn't matter! Sushi will\ncarry me past any obstacle!
Player_StgWin_210_f	There's a suspicious experiment\nhere that I'll put a stop to!
Player_StgWin_211_f	I sure am! I'm gonna get back\nwhat you stole!
Player_StgWin_212_f	It'll have to march on without\nthat gear, then!
Player_StgWin_213_f	Don't believe that guy! Listen\nto your sushi-loving heart!
Player_StgWin_214_f	You don't have to prove youâ€”\nWait, this sounds familiar.
Player_StgWin_215_f	This guy sounds like the worst\nleader I've ever heard of!
Player_StgWin_216_f	This whole squad has been\na real downer to fight...
Player_StgWin_217_f	Why is there a Magnetic Shot\nhere?! What are you guarding?!
Player_StgWin_218_f	That's what you get for building\nmachines that waste sushi!
Player_StgWin_219_f	True happiness could never\ncome through a fake sushi gate!
Player_StgWin_221_f	Hey, I'm not the one who\nbrought it up!
Player_StgWin_222_f	Hearing you say that just makes\nme more curious!
Player_StgWin_223_f	I do feel bad about that. Maybe\ntell him I was just too good?
Player_StgWin_224_f	Sun-o will be happier with\nme anyway!
Player_StgWin_225_f	S-sorry about that. No hard\nfeelings, OK?
Player_StgWin_226_f	I'd come with you, but I've got\na rare sushi sprite to find!
Player_StgWin_227_f	Then that must mean there's\nsomething you were guarding!
Player_StgWin_228_f	When my plates get stolen,\nI just eat more!
Player_StgWin_233_f	I told youâ€”Purrsilla isn't even\nhere anymore.
Player_StgWin_234_f	Did nobody tell you Purrsilla\ndoesn't care about that now?
Player_StgWin_235_f	He's so dedicated that it almost\nbrings a tear to my eye.
Player_StgWin_236_f	I didn't want to be the one to\nbreak it to you, but...
Player_StgWin_237_f	They're not so hard when you\nknow how to handle 'em!
Player_StgWin_238_f	Well, I am. Try not to be a sore\nloser about it!
Player_StgWin_239_f	Nice try, but I think I see a\nshrine up ahead!
Player_StgWin_240_f	Guess it's true what they say:\nyou snooze, you lose!
Player_StgWin_249_f	Hmmm... I don't see\nanything yet.
Player_StgWin_250_f	It must've missed the\nwhole thing...
Player_StgWin_251_f	Believe me, I could tell you\nwere fighting your heart out!
Player_StgWin_252_f	You can trick me, but there's no\ngetting around my sushi skills!
Player_StgWin_253_f	What can I say? I hear the sushi\nsprite calling, that's all!
Player_StgWin_254_f	Just isn't your day, huh?
Player_StgWin_255_f	A sixth sense is cool, but I like\nto say I have a nose for them!
Player_StgWin_256_f	Eat some good sushi and you\nwon't even notice the cold!
Player_StgWin_257_f	It'll be easy! I'll just follow\nmy nose for sushi sprites!
Player_StgWin_258_f	I will, thanks!
Player_StgWin_259_f	Yeah, I could see how being\nout here will do that to you.
Player_StgWin_260_f	This place is so pretty, I'd want\nto lose myself here too.
Player_StgWin_261_f	Wait... This "stealth training"...\nAre you playing hide-and-seek?!
Player_StgWin_262_f	I can't tell if he means with me\nor his hide-and-seek soldiers...
Player_StgWin_263_f	S-sorry about that. Sometimes\nI try a little TOO hard...
Player_StgWin_264_f	Your muscles have a mind of\ntheir own, huh?
Player_StgWin_265_f	Did you even notice that we\nhad a sushi battle just now?
Player_StgWin_266_f	Uhh, how many "minutes" has\nit been now?
Player_StgWin_267_f	Hope you find your friend!
Player_StgWin_268_f	Wake up! It's time to come to\nyour senses!
Player_StgWin_269_f	Where there's Imperials to bust,\nI'll be there doing the busting!
Player_StgWin_270_f	Is it worse that you called me\n"unruly" or a "child"?!
Player_StgWin_271_f	Because I focus on sushi,\nnot psychic mumbo jumbo!
Player_StgWin_272_f	It's easyâ€”I love sushi more than\nyou, so I won!
Player_StgWin_273_f	Seeing you act so fragile all of\na sudden is weird!
Player_StgWin_274_f	I'm only as strong as sushi\nmakes me!
Player_StgWin_275_f	I've fought so many tough\nenemies that I can't help it!
Player_StgWin_276_f	Wow, you take this stuff pretty\nseriously, huh?
Player_StgWin_277_f	I've grown a lot as a sushi\nstriker! But you knew that, huh?
Player_StgWin_278_f	Hey! If I don't get to call you\nold, you can't call me a child!
Player_StgWin_279_f	I already didn't want to,\nand now I'm scared to!
Player_StgWin_280_f	You're right. That's why I'm\ntrying to end this war!
Player_StgWin_281_f	I'm always happy to fight, if it\nhelps you eat!
Player_StgWin_282_f	If there was a weak link, it was\nyour whole general attitude...
Player_StgWin_283_f	Thanks for the compliment, but\ndid you really forget my name?!
Player_StgWin_284_f	Mature? Me? Hey, yeah!\nI AM mature!
Player_StgWin_285_f	If he was this good then, will I\never be better than him?
Player_StgWin_286_f	I've taken apart enough of you\nto know how it works by now!
Player_StgWin_287_f	Is your name also Musashi?\nYou remind me of someone...
Player_StgWin_288_f	Umm... I don't know, did you?\nI don't remember either.
Player_StgWin_289_f	The SLF is better off in my\nhands anyway!
Player_StgWin_290_f	Well, first I eat sushi, and then\nI eat some more!
Player_StgWin_291_f	Why do I think you're going to\ntell her as soon as you can...
Player_StgWin_292_f	That's what sushi striking is\nabout! Get with the program!
Player_StgWin_293_f	I can't afford to hesitate! Not\nwhen it comes to you!
Player_StgWin_294_f	What's under there, anyway?\nCan I get a quick peek?
Player_StgWin_295_f	You're as big a brat as me,\nand you have no excuse!
Player_StgWin_296_f	Thanks! I have to be when I\nfight someone as good as you!
Player_StgWin_297_f	I think you've been training the\nwrong things...
Player_StgWin_298_f	There's nothing wrong with tuna\nor salmon! Don't be stubborn!
Player_StgWin_299_f	I just follow my own path and\nlet sushi be my guide!
Player_StgWin_300_f	Does that mean you're giving\nup? Seems kinda cowardly!
Player_StgWin_301_f	B-but we were both eating\nsushi the whole time!
Player_StgWin_302_f	It's not every day you get to\nfight yourself!
Player_VsWin_Closely	That was a close one! Let's\nhave a rematch, huh?
Player_VsWin	Now that's how a sushi striker\ngets it done!
Player_VsLose_Closely	Awww! I was so close! I'll get\nyou next time for sure!
Player_VsLose	You beat me fair and square.\nBut there's always next time!
Player_VsWin_Closely_f	That was a close one! Let's\nhave a rematch, huh?
Player_VsWin_f	Now that's how a sushi striker\ngets it done!
Player_VsLose_Closely_f	Awww! I was so close! I'll get\nyou next time for sure!
Player_VsLose_f	You beat me fair and square.\nBut there's always next time!
